Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu. == Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife == Mikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least two other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration brought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. == Post shōgunate == Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time."}

Here is the text before \"Here is a sentence\":\n\nOlde Tyme Hardcore is the fifth studio album by the Boston-based hardcore punk band Slapshot. It was released on February 17th, 2017 through Bridge Nine Records and features nine tracks that showcase the band's signature blending of raw, aggressive hardcore punk with catchy, sing-along choruses. The album was well received by critics with Joachim Hiller of Ox-fanzine giving it a positive review, stating that musically, little has changed in the nine songs here: straightforward, brutal Sturm & Drang core in the familiar SLAPSHOT style. The album title and lyrics of the title track demonstrate what the Boston band thinks of people who think SLAPSHOT's best days are behind them."}

Here's the text before \"Here is a sentence\":\n\nIn 1899, when Willie was nine and George was just six years old, they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhibit in traveling circus freaks shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins, as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted and taken on the road with various circuses, including Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers' lodging and clothing. However the brothers were not paid wages and were cruelly exploited. They were often portrayed as savages and cannibals, and were dehumanized, with Shelton even claiming that they were aliens from Mars and descended from monkeys from \"the dark continent.\" Shleton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order prevent them from trying to contact her. The brothers were also used as case studies for scientific research."}

Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like home movie gone wrong for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\""}
