The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field (200–240G) and a rotation period ~73.7 days, distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target of further study, notable for demonstrating detection planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in strong stellar magnetic fields presence."}
