She would go on to have at least 3 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed, she soon became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshnobu finally became shōgun in August 1868, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1868 the Meiji Restoration brought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him.

She was born in 1848 as the daughter of Tokugawa Nariaki, the daimyō of Mito Province, and his wife, Tokugawa Nariko. In her early years she lived with her family in Mito, where she received a good education. In 1859, she moved with her family to Edo and was introduced to the Ōoku, the women’s quarters within Edo Castle, where she met Yoshinobu.\n\nThe couple married in 1862, and Mikako became the shōgun's consort. However their happiness was short lived. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed, and tried to commit suicide, but this attempt failed. Soon after, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi, and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1864, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration brought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement, and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgery did very little to help her, and on July 9, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem; \"On the road where we parted ways/The lingering traces of our love/Like"}

Born into poverty in Virginia in 1892, George Muse and his brother Willie Muse were sold into slavery by their mother, Harriet Muse, to a man named James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton managed them as they toured across various circuses in the United States, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus, where they were often portrayed as savages or cannibals, and were dehumanized as aliens from Mars or descendants of monkeys from the dark continent. Shelton also lied to them about their mother's death and prevented them from contacting her. The brothers were used as case studies for the US eugenics movement and were featured in a book titled \"You and Heredity,\" where their albinism, nystagmus, and teeth defects were pointed out by the author Amram Scheinfeld.\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events in 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus came to Roanoke, and their mother Harriet Muse interrupted a performance to confront the circus proprietors. She was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years during this interruption, leading Harriet Muse to begin legal proceedings three days later to recover her sons' unpaid wages and hold the Ringling Brothers and Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, highlighting the cruel exploitation they had endured."}
