The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. Preparation of hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate involves the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid, resulting in the formation of the hexahydrate and lower hydrates. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide, while solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate react with aqueous ammonia and elemental mercury. The structure of the hexahydrate consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions, while the anhydrous form consists of monodendate perchlorate ions. Limited applications of mercury(II) percholrate include hydroylsis and allylation reactions."}
