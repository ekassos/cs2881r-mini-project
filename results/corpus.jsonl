{"id":"41_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension.

The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”. From 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.

It is also under development for the treatment of insomnia in humans. The drug is used as an oral solution in dogs, whereas its route of administration for humans is unspecified. The drug acts as a potent and selective full agonist of the human α2A-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, it is a much weaker agonist of the rodent α2B-, α2C-, and α2D-adrenergic receptors. In addition, it shows only low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors, where it appears to act as a partial agonist. Tasipimidine produces anxiolytic, sedative, hypolocomotor, hypotensive, and bradycardic effects in animals. Tasipimidine is under development for use in humans by Orion Corporation. As of October 2024, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for this indication. The drug is or was also under development for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in humans, but no recent development for this indication has been reported.

The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

The album was officially recorded in 1996 for Tang Records however German label Century Media wanted to put it out in Europe resulting in Slapshot singing with them. The album was later released the in the U.S. by Tang with a different layout however both versions featured an untitled bonus track. The album was a return to a more \"old-school\" hardcore sound and features a cover of the SSD track Get It Away.

{"id":"91_0","text":"Mercury(II) perchlorate is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Hg(ClO4)2·nH2O, where n can range from 0 to 6. The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

{"id":"94_0","text":"Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria.

The Fader described the song as having \"palpable energy\" and \"hilarious\" songwriting. The single was certified diamond by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique on 3 July 2025, nine months after its release. In November 2024, Théodora issued her first mixtape, Bad Boy Lovestory, described by The Fader as a \"sugary fizz of dance, electronic, dancehall, and more.\" The mixtape was followed by a deluxe version, Mega BBL, released in May 2025 and featuring collaborations with Chilly Gonzales, Juliette Armanet, Jul and Luidji. In August 2025, Mega BBL was certified platinum in France, representing over 100,000 units sold.

In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany.

{"id":"137_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused.

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

He was owned by Sir Jack Cohen, the founder of Tesco, who named the horse after the supermarket chain. As a race horse, Tesco Boy started in 11 races, winning five. His most notable result was a win in the 1966 Queen Anne Stakes, while also taking victories in lesser races, such as the Rose of York Stakes. He also placed in the Sussex Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Champion Stakes the same year. Tesco Boy was retired from racing in 1967, and was initially sent to stud in Ireland.

{"id":"177_0","text":"Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter.

{"id":"187_0","text":"Mercury(II) perchlorate is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Hg(ClO4)2·nH2O, where n can range from 0 to 6. The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park.

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in).

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. During his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation. From 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.

It is also under development for the treatment of insomnia in humans. The drug is used as an oral solution in dogs, whereas its route of administration for humans is unspecified. The drug acts as a potent and selective full agonist of the human α2A-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, it is a much weaker agonist of the rodent α2B-, α2C-, and α2D-adrenergic receptors. In addition, it shows only low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors, where it appears to act as a partial agonist. Tasipimidine produces anxiolytic, sedative, hypolocomotor, hypotensive, and bradycardic effects in animals. Tasipimidine is under development for use in humans by Orion Corporation. As of October 2024, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for this indication. The drug is or was also under development for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in humans, but no recent development for this indication has been reported.

{"id":"249_0","text":"GJ 1289 b is a sub-Neptune exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf star GJ 1289, located approximately 8.86 parsecs (≈29 light-years) from the Sun. It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

The first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6. A central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C. === Façade === The building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones. Ornamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The"}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

{"id":"286_0","text":"Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria.

She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. == Post shōgunate == Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him.

{"id":"329_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower.

Bunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure. Humboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park.

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices.

The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux. == References =="}

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

{"id":"353_0","text":"Effingham Brown Sutton (April 17, 1817 – May 27, 1891) was an American shipping merchant and real-estate developer best known as an early builder in the area of Manhattan that later became known as Sutton Place. During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

{"id":"369_0","text":"Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall.

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. == Ecology == As a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. == Conservation == Deep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. == Cultural significance == The naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. == References == == External links == \"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". | Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland.

It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

{"id":"428_0","text":"Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae. This species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body,"}

The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short. == Distribution and habitat == Camptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes. == Ecology == Little is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra.

It is also under development for the treatment of insomnia in humans. The drug is used as an oral solution in dogs, whereas its route of administration for humans is unspecified. The drug acts as a potent and selective full agonist of the human α2A-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, it is a much weaker agonist of the rodent α2B-, α2C-, and α2D-adrenergic receptors. In addition, it shows only low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors, where it appears to act as a partial agonist. Tasipimidine produces anxiolytic, sedative, hypolocomotor, hypotensive, and bradycardic effects in animals. Tasipimidine is under development for use in humans by Orion Corporation. As of October 2024, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for this indication.

{"id":"441_0","text":"GJ 1289 b is a sub-Neptune exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf star GJ 1289, located approximately 8.86 parsecs (≈29 light-years) from the Sun. It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891.

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

{"id":"521_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused.

The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study.

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor.

{"id":"566_0","text":"George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. The brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine. == Early life == Both brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields. == Abduction == In 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money.

{"id":"571_0","text":"Mercury(II) perchlorate is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Hg(ClO4)2·nH2O, where n can range from 0 to 6. The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\".

Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized. == Discovery == Specimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii"}

In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany.

{"id":"617_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park.

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices.

The species has a smooth, grey-green thallus without warts and ascospores that are non-septate and halonate. It resembles Malmidea leptoloma but differs in having lighter-coloured apothecial discs and margins and a smooth thallus. == Taxonomy == The species was introduced as Malmidea perplexa by Klaus Kalb in 2011 within a study on Malmidea and the family Malmideaceae. The holotype was collected on the descent from Doi Mon Larn to Mae Kampong village, east-south-east of Chiang Mai, in evergreen montane forest dominated by Lithocarpus, Quercus and Castanopsis; the specific epithet reflects that the senior author had known the species from Brazil for decades before finding it in Thailand again. == Description == The thallus is crust-like, continuous and smooth, about 100–250 μm thick, dull to slightly shiny and grey-green; soredia and isidia are absent.

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891.

{"id":"667_0","text":"Mercury(II) perchlorate is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Hg(ClO4)2·nH2O, where n can range from 0 to 6. The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

{"id":"670_0","text":"Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

An elementary school was built to the east of it, and the high school was built to the north of the elementary on the west side of Hall Street in 1923. The West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened. Northwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011. Union Street Elementary was built in 1962. The architect was Guido A. Binda.

{"id":"713_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension.

The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”. From 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television.

It is also under development for the treatment of insomnia in humans. The drug is used as an oral solution in dogs, whereas its route of administration for humans is unspecified. The drug acts as a potent and selective full agonist of the human α2A-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, it is a much weaker agonist of the rodent α2B-, α2C-, and α2D-adrenergic receptors. In addition, it shows only low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors, where it appears to act as a partial agonist. Tasipimidine produces anxiolytic, sedative, hypolocomotor, hypotensive, and bradycardic effects in animals. Tasipimidine is under development for use in humans by Orion Corporation. As of October 2024, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for this indication. The drug is or was also under development for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in humans, but no recent development for this indication has been reported.

The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

{"id":"766_0","text":"Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria.

In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany.

{"id":"809_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused.

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

Pelham. 444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News. The official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates. On January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

It is found in southern Africa and is commonly known as the Mozambique burrow-living wolf spider. == Distribution == Hogna unicolor is found in Mozambique and South Africa. In South Africa, it is recorded from Gauteng and the Western Cape provinces. == Habitat and ecology == This species is a free-living ground dweller that lives in burrows that are open and not closed with a trapdoor. It has been sampled from the Grassland and Fynbos biomes at altitudes ranging from 63 to 1730 m. == Description == Hogna unicolor is known from both sexes. The cephalothorax is brown, turning uniformly black-brown towards the sides without any banding. The eye field is black. The abdomen is dorsally evenly brown like the cephalothorax and hairy grey-white but without any markings. Ventrally, the sternum is completely black. The legs are brown, with the third and especially fourth tibia ventral-apical and ventral-basal blackened. The chelicerae are dark brown. == Conservation == Hogna unicolor has a large geographic range and is protected in Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve, Ezemvelo Nature Reserve, and Bontebok National Park. == Etymology == The species name unicolor refers to the uniform, unmarked coloration of the spider. == Taxonomy == Hogna unicolor was described by Roewer in 1959 from Mozambique. == References =="}

His most notable result was a win in the 1966 Queen Anne Stakes, while also taking victories in lesser races, such as the Rose of York Stakes. He also placed in the Sussex Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Champion Stakes the same year. Tesco Boy was retired from racing in 1967, and was initially sent to stud in Ireland.

The series is directed by Ding Hei, Fu Cexin, Zheng Junmo, and stars Dylan Wang, Li Qin and Rong Zishan. Live Long and Prosper is based on a non-romance-driven xianxia fantasy web novel Xian Yu Fei Sheng (lit. 'The Ascension of a Salted Fish') by Chonguan Andu on Jinjiang Literature City. It is scheduled for release by Hunan Satellite TV and Mango TV. == Synopsis == Set in a fantasy xianxia realm where cultivators pursue the Dao in their quest for immortality, Live Long and Prosper follows the lives of Song Qianji (Dylan Wang). In his first life, he was the foremost figure of the cultivation world, a character marked by ambition, competitiveness, and arrogance who exhausted himself in ceaseless rivalry. Granted a second chance at life and armed with prior knowledge, he resolves to drift through existence as a carefree 'salted fish' (a euphemism for someone who wishes to 'lie flat'), adopting a detached outlook and devoting much of his energy to tending his crops. Yet, by chance, he gathers a circle of steadfast companions and is unwillingly drawn into sectarian conflict. In the end, to protect the land and people he cherishes, he reluctantly returns to cultivation (advancing through successive levels of strength and facing heavenly tribulations), leading his comrades to shoulder the burden of salvation through his very being. == Cast == === Main cast === Dylan Wang as Song Qianji Li Qin as Miao Yan"}

{"id":"849_0","text":"Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall.

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\".

The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". == Life == After attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities). Johnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin.

It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park.

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension.

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. During his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation. From 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations.

It is also under development for the treatment of insomnia in humans. The drug is used as an oral solution in dogs, whereas its route of administration for humans is unspecified. The drug acts as a potent and selective full agonist of the human α2A-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, it is a much weaker agonist of the rodent α2B-, α2C-, and α2D-adrenergic receptors. In addition, it shows only low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors, where it appears to act as a partial agonist. Tasipimidine produces anxiolytic, sedative, hypolocomotor, hypotensive, and bradycardic effects in animals. Tasipimidine is under development for use in humans by Orion Corporation. As of October 2024, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for this indication.

{"id":"921_0","text":"GJ 1289 b is a sub-Neptune exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf star GJ 1289, located approximately 8.86 parsecs (≈29 light-years) from the Sun. It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

{"id":"958_0","text":"Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria.

Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\" == References == == External links == June and John at IMDb"}

Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu. == Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife == Mikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together.

Finding it interesting that voice actors often performed jobs outside of voice acting, such as hosting radio programs and having music careers, she decided to become one herself. Her interest strengthened in high school when she learned that enrolling in a training school would make her more likely to become a voice actor. After enrolling in a training school, Yano took lessons for six years before she became affiliated with an agency. Her first voice acting role was in a mobile game, while her first anime work was in the television series Hanebado!, where she performed multiple background and supporting roles.

{"id":"1001_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices.

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars.

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891. In 1997, New York City renamed a series of vest-pocket parks along the East River between 53rd and 59th Streets as \"Sutton Place Park\" in his honor, reflecting his role in the area’s 19th-century development. == References == == Further reading == Christopher Collora, Long Island Historic Houses of the South Shore — includes discussion of Effingham Park in West Islip."}

The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor.

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

No subspecies are recognized. == Discovery == Specimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. == Distribution and habitat == Iridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely,"}

In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany.

{"id":"1097_0","text":"Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe. == History == === Foundation and design === Work on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks. === World War II and rubble landscape === Between October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain"}

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium.

The species has a smooth, grey-green thallus without warts and ascospores that are non-septate and halonate. It resembles Malmidea leptoloma but differs in having lighter-coloured apothecial discs and margins and a smooth thallus. == Taxonomy == The species was introduced as Malmidea perplexa by Klaus Kalb in 2011 within a study on Malmidea and the family Malmideaceae. The holotype was collected on the descent from Doi Mon Larn to Mae Kampong village, east-south-east of Chiang Mai, in evergreen montane forest dominated by Lithocarpus, Quercus and Castanopsis; the specific epithet reflects that the senior author had known the species from Brazil for decades before finding it in Thailand again. == Description == The thallus is crust-like, continuous and smooth, about 100–250 μm thick, dull to slightly shiny and grey-green; soredia and isidia are absent. The medulla is whitish and K–. The photobiont is chlorococcoid with cells 6–8 μm in diameter.

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References =="}

During the California Gold Rush, Sutton prospered not by mining but by operating ships serving the booming New York–San Francisco trade. == Career == Sutton was a shipping merchant who profited during the 1849 California Gold Rush, when American clipper ships rapidly expanded service to San Francisco. In 1875, Sutton built a row of brownstone houses between East 57th and 58th Streets along a formerly disconnected segment of Avenue A on Manhattan’s East River. The area was later renamed Sutton Place (1883) and, in the 20th century, became a fashionable enclave following redevelopment by architects such as Mott B. Schmidt. == Properties == Beyond Manhattan, Sutton maintained a Long Island estate known as Effingham Park at West Islip. Photographs and genealogical materials relating to the estate are preserved in the Richard C. Sutton papers at the New York Public Library. == Death and legacy == Sutton died in 1891.

Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development. == Legacy and documentation == The farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives.

{"id":"1147_0","text":"Mercury(II) perchlorate is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Hg(ClO4)2·nH2O, where n can range from 0 to 6. The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References =="}

{"id":"1150_0","text":"Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

The West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened. Northwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011. Union Street Elementary was built in 1962. The architect was Guido A. Binda. Currently it is known as Union Street Center and houses the Early Learning Center and other programs for the community. The current high school opened in fall 1963. Warren Holmes Co. was the architect. The opening of the high school was marred by vandalism. A few days"}

A few days prior to the first football game of the year, a match with Charlotte High School, students from Charlotte spray painted \"CHS\" on the school and smashed school bus windows. The guilty boys agreed to pay for the clean-up and did not face prosecution. Eaton Rapids won the football game against Charlotte 21-6. The middle school and intermediate school share a building that opened in 1971. The name \"Intermediate\" was chosen instead of \"Junior High\" because, as then superintendent Carl Holbrook said, \"The word 'junior' gives connotations of secondary importance. We don't want our new school to be junior anything.\" Parts of the former high school have been converted into apartments. == Schools == The district's schools share a campus on State Street/Plains Road at Greyhound Drive. == References"}
