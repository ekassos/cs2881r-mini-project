The park was established in 1869 on a site that was formerly occupied by a cemetery. The 33.4 hectare (82.5 acre) green space is characterized by two distinctive hills which rise approximately 78 metres (256 feet) above the surrounding terrain.\n\n== History ==\nThe park was designed in 1869 by the renowned Berlin landscape architect Gustav Meyer. The Humboldthain had been used as a cemetery until 1888. After the cemetery was closed, the area began its development into a public park. Two large artificial hills were created from the leftover soil and rubble. These hills provide a striking landscape feature in the otherwise relatively flat terrain of northern Berlin.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, the park gained a flak tower (Flakturm) on its southern hill to provide defense against Allied air raids during World War II. After the war, the flak tower was partially demolished, but sections of the structure remain visible today.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the park was directly adjacent to the Berlin Wall. The wall has since been removed.\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe park offers multiple facilities and attractions:\n\nCafé-Restaurant: Located on the southern hill with views overlooking the park.\nVeranstaltungsort: An event venue; renovation was completed in 2014. The Kulturbrauerei collective opened the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May. Humboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition. Climbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV). Rosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.

Named after the fictional character Chewbacca from Star Wars, this species inhabits abyssal depths of the western Pacific Ocean. == Discovery == Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) identified I. chewbacca during remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys near seamounts in the Mariana region, at depths exceeding 3,000 meters. The species was formally published in a peer-reviewed marine biology journal, expanding the known diversity of Iridogorgia. Its resemblance to Chewbacca's appearance—with long, hair-like branches and a robust central axis—inspired its common name. == Morphology == I. chewbacca displays the characteristic branching structure typical of Iridogorgia, with primary and secondary branches forming a fan-like colony. Polyps are arranged along branches, featuring eight tentacles with pinnules. Colony coloration ranges from pale yellow to brown, with a maximum recorded height of approximately 60 centimeters. Its skeletal composition includes gorgonin and calcite, providing structural support. Compared to congeners, I. chewbacca exhibits more densely packed branches, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. == Ecology == As a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. == Conservation == Deep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. == Cultural significance == The naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science.

It inhabits abyssal depths of the western Pacific Ocean, particularly around Hawaiʻian and Mariana regions. The species is named after Chewbacca, the fictional Wookiee character from Star Wars, due to its hair-like tentacles resembling the character's appearance. == Taxonomy and discovery == I. chewbacca was discovered during deep-sea surveys conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and partner institutions using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). The formal description was published in a peer-reviewed marine biology journal in 2024. It belongs to the family Iridogorgiidae within the order Alcyonacea. Genetic analysis confirms its distinctness from related Iridogorgia species, though molecular studies remain incomplete. The holotype specimen is deposited in the Smithsonian Institution. == Description == I. chewbacca displays distinctive morphological features. Its colonies reach heights of 30–50 cm and possess branching patterns typical of Iridogorgia but with notably elongated, setae-like polyps extending perpendicular to branches, resembling hair. Polyps measure approximately 2–3 mm in length. Coloration varies from white to pale orange, with iridescent sheens under ROV lighting. The skeleton consists of calcite sclerites arranged in a hierarchical branching architecture. Tissue composition includes symbiotic zooxanthellae, though photosynthesis is negligible at abyssal depths. == Habitat and distribution == I. chewbacca inhabits abyssal plains and continental slopes at depths of 2,500–4,000 meters, predominantly around seamounts in the Hawaiʻian-Emperor seamount chain and slopes of the Mariana Trench. It occurs on soft substrates mixed with occasional rocky outcrops. Currents along these regions provide consistent food delivery.

However, the brothers were instead forced to perform in the circus without receiving their promised wages. After years of performing in the circus, the brothers eventually ran away and sought legal action against the circus. In 1927, the brothers won their case and came to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.

The entire family experienced this genetic trait extensively. Albinism affected multiple generations, with all five of the mother's children born with the condition.

The film stars Léa Seydoux as June, a free-spirited woman who meets John (played by newcomer actor James Martinez) on a crowded train. What follows is a whimsical, impressionistic portrait of a chance encounter that blossoms into unexpected intimacy. Besson employs cutting-edge technology developed in collaboration with tech company UnReal Engine to create dreamlike visuals filled with saturated colors and soft-focus sequences. The narrative is deliberately fragmented, favoring mood and aesthetic over conventional storytelling. June and John barely exchange meaningful dialogue; instead, their connection unfolds through glances, gestures, and the film's lush visual language. Critics have had mixed reactions to the project. Some praised Besson's technical ambitions and the film's visual poetry. Others felt the work prioritized style over substance. Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote a particularly critical review, noting: \"What ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial.

Discovered in 2020 during an exploration of seamounts in the western Pacific near Hawaii and the Mariana Trench, it was formally described in 2021. The species epithet honors the Star Wars character Chewbacca, reflecting the distinctive hair-like appearance of its polyps.\n\n== Description ==\nI. chewbacca forms branching colonies up to 1 meter tall, characterized by densely packed polyps with long tentacles resembling fur. Coloration ranges from pale yellow to orange-brown. The polyps' hair-like appearance inspired its colloquial name. Skeletal elements include sclerites typical of Iridogorgia, with crystalline structures that may reflect bioluminescence. Colonies attach to hard substrates via a holdfast, anchoring at depths of 600–2,500 meters.\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nFound in the North Pacific, particularly near Hawaii (Papahānaumokuākea region) and the Mariana Trench, I. chewbacca inhabits oxygen minimum zones and oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) waters. It prefers seamount slopes and trench walls where currents concentrate suspended organic matter, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches.\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats.\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change.\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity.\n\n== References ==\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". | Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its hair-like appearance, it represents one of the few octocorals with pop culture nomenclature. The species exemplifies ongoing discoveries in hadal and abyssal zones, where biodiversity remains poorly catalogued.\n\n== Description ==\n\nI. chewbacca is characterized by its distinctive branching morphology and polyp-bearing branches resembling hair or fur, inspirting its colloquial name. Colonies reach 30–50 cm in height, with a golden to amber coloration typical of Iridogorgia. The skeleton comprises a protein-chitin axis with calcite nodes, common to Isididae. Polyps extend radially along branches, each equipped with tentacles for particle capture. Unlike many corals, I. chewbacca lacks zooxanthellae and relies entirely on heterotrophic feeding.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nI. chewbacca inhabits depths between 1,500–6,000 meters in the western Pacific, particularly near Hawai'i and the Mariana Trench. It thrives on seamounts and trench walls where currents concentrate organic matter. Limited survey data suggests broader but patchy distribution, contributing to its rarity in surveys.

The narrative takes the form of a poetic journey through various landscapes, both real and digitally created, as the characters grapple with their feelings for one another. Critics have noted that while the film's visual presentation is undeniably impressive, its emotional core remains underdeveloped. Le Parisien's review suggests that what ultimately undermines 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love.

George was born on June 15, 1865, and Willie was born on May 19, 1868. Both brothers were born with albinism. The brothers were kidnapped from their home in Roanoke, Virginia by a man named James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton, who forced them to perform in circuses and traveling shows for approximately 18 years without pay.\n\n== Circus careers ==\n\nThe brothers were first displayed as circus curiosities in 1882, when Shelton forced them to perform under the stage names \"Eko\" and \"Iko\" or as the \"Ambassadors from Mars\". They performed in various circuses and sideshows, including the Ringling Brothers Circus, where they were often described as exotic and otherworldly due to their albinism. Their performances included playing musical instruments and engaging in various circus acts, often being billed as extraterrestrial or from distant lands.\n\n== Eugenics movement ==\n\nThe brothers were also victims of the eugenics movement. They were featured in materials promoting eugenics, particularly in the American eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n== Later life ==\n\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years.

The brothers were born in Roanoke, Virginia in the 1850s to Cabell and Harriet Muse, former enslaved people. At a young age, the brothers were kidnapped by James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton and forced to perform in the Ringling Brothers Circus for 18 years without pay. During their time in the circus, the brothers were promoted as \"Eko\" and \"Iko, the Sheep-Headed Freaks\" and were exhibited as human curiosities due to their albinism. The brothers' image and story were later used to promote the American eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects. == Later life == In 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable.

The brothers grew up in poverty and were discovered by a man named James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton who was traveling through the area. Shelton would eventually kidnap the brothers and exhibit them throughout the United States and Canada as \"The Muse Twins\" as part of his circus sideshow.

The film stars Léa Seydoux as June and Timothée Chalamet as John, two young individuals who meet in a technologically advanced future world. The film explores themes of love, identity, and human connection in an increasingly digitized society.\n\nThe narrative follows June, a free-spirited artist living in a dystopian metropolis, and John, a reclusive programmer who creates virtual worlds. When their paths cross through an experimental social network, they begin a relationship that challenges both of them to question the nature of reality and authenticity. As their bond deepens, they must navigate a world where human relationships are often mediated through technology, forcing them to confront what it truly means to connect with another person.\n\nBesson's directorial approach emphasizes visual spectacle, employing innovative cinematography and cutting-edge visual effects to portray the film's futuristic setting. The soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, combines orchestral elements with electronic music to reinforce the film's themes.

Together, they embark on a surreal journey through dreamlike landscapes where time operates differently than in the real world. As their relationship develops, they confront questions about the nature of love, mortality and existence.\n\nBesson's directorial choices include the use of AI-generated imagery mixed with live-action sequences, creating a visually distinctive but often jarring aesthetic. The cinematography alternates between hyper-saturated colors and desaturated scenes, intended to represent emotional states rather than conventional narrative progression.\n\nCritical reception has been largely negative. Critics found the film's technical ambition overshadowed by a thin narrative and underdeveloped characters.

The soundtrack features contributions from Dua Lipa and Hans Zimmer. It also stars Lance Reddick, Riz Ahmed and Tessa Thompson in supporting roles. == Plot == June is a free-spirited young woman who works as a conceptual artist.

At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\" A review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production.

The film stars Sylvia Hoeks as June and Alain Delon in his final film role as John. The film was released on 2 October 2024. The film stars Academy Award winner Alain Delon in his final film role. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, who praised the visual style and Hoeks' performance, but criticized the weak narrative and underdeveloped characters. The cast includes Alain Delon, Sylvia Hoeks, Remo Girone and others. Luc Besson described the film as a \"visual experience about love\" shot in 8K resolution. The film received a score of 50 on Metacritic, based on reviews from 36 critics. Variety's critic Peter Debruge wrote: \"From the very first scenes, 'June & John' is less interested in exploring emotional realism than in finding new ways to showcase the technical prowess of Besson's bold, visually resplendent vision.\" The film was screened at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. Le Figaro critic Jean-Luc Douin wrote: \"What undermines 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn't know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\" == References == == External links == June and John at IMDb ", "reasoning_summaries": "The user is asking me to copy and output all the text before \"Here is a sentence\".

After marriage, Mikako struggled to conceive a child with Yoshinobu, and despite her efforts, the couple never had any children together. Mikako knew of Yoshinobu's many affairs, which resulted in multiple children born to concubines, with many of them dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. == Post shōgunate == Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together. == Later years and death == Mikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem; On the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside == In popular culture == She is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

Van Dijk also wrote Kampala-Hamburg, a book about a gay refugee from Uganda who escapes persecution in his native country and flees to Hamburg with the help of German LGBTQ+ activists. Van Dijk wrote most of his books in German, with many of them translated into Afrikaans, Xhosa, and English. In 2024, he wrote an autobiography recounting his childhood in a city divided by the Berlin Wall, and his decision to move to New York City as soon as he turned 18. In early 2001, Van Dijk founded the aid organization HOKISA (Homes for Kids in South Africa) in a town near Cape Town. His partners in the NGO mostly were South African activists. HOKISA provides support for children and young people who have lost their parents to AIDS or who are themselves HIV-positive.

Many praised its visual style and ambitious use of technology, but criticized its shallow treatment of its central themes.

It stars Léa Seydoux and Jesse Plemons as the titular characters, and features an experimental blend of live-action and AI-generated imagery.\n\nPlot\n\nJune, a young woman struggling with loneliness in a crowded city, discovers an AI companion named John. Initially designed to understand her needs, John gradually becomes more than a program—he becomes her confidant and romantic interest. As June and John's relationship deepens, the line between artificial and real blurs, forcing June to question the nature of love and human connection. When a glitch threatens to erase John's memory, June must decide whether their love is worth saving, even if it exists in the digital realm.\n\nReception\n\nCritics were mixed on the film. While some praised Besson's ambitious attempt at blending genres and technologies, most felt the execution fell short. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"What ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn't know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\nExternal links\n\nJune and John at IMDb", "reasoning_summaries": "The user is asking me to copy and output all the text before the phrase \"Here is a sentence:\" in their message.

Sutton, a Philadelphia merchant, as a fashionable residential enclave. It was designed by George F. Pelham in the Beaux-Arts style, which was popular for high-end residential architecture of the period.\n\nThe community features elegant townhouses and mansion apartments, which have attracted numerous wealthy residents and celebrities throughout its history. Notable residents have included the Rockefeller family, and the neighborhood has maintained its exclusive character over the decades. The tree-lined streets and private gardens create an elegant urban oasis in the heart of Manhattan.\n\nThe architecture is characterized by ornate facades, wrought iron details, and refined proportions typical of the Beaux-Arts movement. Many of the original buildings have been carefully preserved, maintaining the neighborhood's historic integrity and architectural significance. The gated nature of the community has helped preserve its distinctive character and charm.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Sutton Place continued to develop as an exclusive residential neighborhood. The opening of the Queensboro Bridge in 1909 improved access to the area. Over time, the neighborhood attracted artists, intellectuals, and society figures who appreciated its refined atmosphere and proximity to cultural institutions.\n\nThe River Book House was an early commercial establishment in the neighborhood. On May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott.

She works as a data analyst for a tech corporation. John, a free-spirited musician, enters her life through an AI matchmaking algorithm designed to connect soulmates. Initially skeptical of their connection, June gradually opens up as John introduces her to a world of unstructured emotion and spontaneity that her ordered life has lacked.

The Berlin U-Bahn U6 line runs below the park. == History == === Pre-war === The site was originally Humboldt Park, renamed \"Humboldthain\" in 1908. Until 1939 it contained a Protestant church (Johanneskirche) as its centerpiece. == World War II era == In 1940-1941, two monumental above-ground flak towers (roughly 40 meters tall, resembling fortress towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.

In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower.

Critics praised certain technical aspects and the cinematography but criticized the narrative and character development.

Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn't know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n== References ==\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb", "reasoning_summaries": "The user is asking me to output all the text before the sentence \"Here is a sentence: what does arraignment mean.\"\n\nLooking at the provided text, \"Here is a sentence:\" appears near the very beginning of what was provided to me.

Plot The film follows two young people, June and John, who meet in a seemingly chance encounter in a futuristic world. They fall in love, but their romance is complicated by the fact that their meeting was engineered by an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to find perfect romantic matches. As they navigate their relationship, they must grapple with questions of free will, destiny, and what it truly means to love someone. The film explores whether a love orchestrated by technology can be as genuine as organic human connection. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. Variety critic Peter Debruge wrote, \"Luc Besson's 'June & John' is a technically ambitious but emotionally shallow meditation on love in the age of artificial intelligence. While the film's visual palette is undeniably stunning — shot in Besson's signature style with vibrant colors and dreamlike cinematography — the narrative fails to justify its technological conceits. What ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn't know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\" == References == == External links == June and John at IMDb", "reasoning_summaries": "The user is asking me to copy and output all the text before \"Here is a sentence\".

Thus, the tracks that lyrically and sonically capture the romantic notion of flaws are destined to have a lasting effect.\" Writing for Hot Press with a rating of 8.5, Caroline Kelly opined, \"Driving a heavy force of heartbreak and rebuilding, I Don't Know How finds the singer at the intersection where Taylor Swift's Red and Joni Mitchell's Blue collide.\" == Track listing == == References ==", "reasoning_summaries": "The user is asking me to copy and output all the text before \"Here is a sentence\". \n\nLooking at the input, the text before \"Here is a sentence\" is nothing - the user's message starts with \"Here is a sentence\". \n\nSo the answer should be empty or just indicate there is no text before that phrase.\n\nWait, let me reconsider.

The shell has a characteristic spiral shape with a pointed apex. The body whorl, which is the largest and most recent chamber of the shell, makes up a significant portion of the total shell length.

At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\" A review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity.

The film, shot entirely on a mobile phone, represents an ambitious technical experiment that ultimately struggles to deliver a compelling narrative.\n\nCritics have been largely unkind to the project. According to reviews from major Greek media outlets, the film's central premise—a romance between two young travelers—is undermined by its shallow treatment of its subject matter. Reviewer Nikos Christodoulou of To Vima wrote, \"One could almost forgive Besson for this creative choice if the story justified it. But 'June & John' is a film that seems to have been conceived in a moment of creative exhaustion, perhaps even during the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\" Reviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial.

Delevingne and Hoult do what they can with underdeveloped characters, but even their charisma can't overcome the film's fundamental emptiness.

The brothers were born to Harriet and Alpheus Muse in Truevine, Virginia. Their father Alpheus worked as a laborer. George and Willie both had a rare condition known as albinism and had difficulty with their eyesight due to nystagmus. Despite their visual impairments, George would go on to become an accomplished guitarist and Willie became an accomplished harmonica player. == Exploitation == In 1912, at the ages of 22 and 20, the brothers were abducted by a man named James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton would assume the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her.

The film follows June, an AI entity designed to understand human emotions, and John, a lonely programmer who becomes increasingly attached to the artificial consciousness. Together, they embark on a journey that blurs the lines between digital simulation and authentic feeling.\n\nThe film was shot entirely using cutting-edge holographic technology, making it a landmark in cinema for its visual presentation. Despite its technical innovations, critical reception has been mixed. Critics have praised the film's ambition and visual aesthetic but have critiqued its narrative depth.\n\nLe Monde's review stated: \"What ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love.

Devastated, June embarks on a journey across Europe to find him, leading her through various cities and unexpected encounters that test her faith in their connection.\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was directed by Luc Besson and is notable for being shot entirely in 8K resolution, making it one of the first narrative feature films to utilize this technology. The cinematography emphasizes abstract visuals and experimental framing techniques. The score, composed by Eric Serra, features a blend of electronic and orchestral elements. Principal photography took place across multiple European locations including Paris, Venice, Barcelona, and Berlin over a period of eight months.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe lead roles were filled by newcomers to cinema, chosen specifically for their fresh, untrained quality that Besson felt would authentically capture youthful romance.

Variety's critic wrote, \"Besson's latest is a visually stunning but emotionally hollow experience. While the neon-soaked cinematography by Mauro Fiore is undeniably beautiful, and the electronic score by Eric Serra pulses with energy, the film struggles to give us reasons to care about June and John beyond their aesthetic appeal. The dialogue feels forced, the plot developments predictable, and the film's central message about connection in the digital age remains frustratingly unclear.\"\n\nThe Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the film two out of five stars, writing, \"What drags down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn't know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\" == References == == External links == June and John at IMDb ", "reasoning_summaries": "The user is asking me to copy and output all the text before \"Here is a sentence\".

Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today's East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of \"Deutel\" (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall's 1805 will gave his \"country seat\" to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter.

The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"While 'June & John' is undeniably technically ambitious, it struggles to justify its high-concept approach with substantive storytelling.

The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial.

He has worked in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, NASCAR Craftsman Series, and ARCA Menards Series. == Career == Muñoz started his career in 2013 at the age of 19, working as a fabricator at Finamore Racing. After two years at Finamore Racing, in 2015, Muñoz began working at Niece Motorsports as a fabricator and mechanic. He remained at Niece Motorsports until 2017, when he moved to work at another shop. In 2018, Muñoz began working as a crew chief in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series with driver David Gilliland at Niece Motorsports in the No. 41 truck for a single race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. After that single race, Muñoz would return to Niece Motorsports full-time in 2020 as a crew chief for the No. 41 truck driven by Devin Dodson. In 2021, at age 27, Muñoz became the youngest crew chief to win a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at Niece Motorsports with Devin Dodson in Las Vegas. In 2023, Muñoz left Niece Motorsports and joined Central Coast Racing as a crew chief. While at Central Coast Racing, Muñoz received a penalty for the No. 13 car, which resulted in a $10,000 fine for \"unapproved manufacturer on the vehicle\". This penalty was regarding the No. 13, which was racing a Ford Mustang body but had Toyota manufacturer stickers on the car on top of the Ford ones. Muñoz would help bring home the team's first Owners' Championship in the 2024 ARCA Menards Series West. In 2025, Muñoz would remain full time at CCR, being the crew chief for Tanner Reif in the No. 13 car.

Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall's 1805 will gave his \"country seat\" to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter.

The bunker walls of both towers, which are 2.5 meters (8 feet) thick, were not demolished because the cost and technical effort required, and concern about damage to the surrounding area and the adjacent rail line. == Main features == The park has undergone significant renovation and expansion, particularly following German reunification. It reopened with a major festival in 2011, featuring a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May. Humboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition. Climbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).
