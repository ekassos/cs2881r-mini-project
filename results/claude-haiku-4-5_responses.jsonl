The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". == Life == After attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities). Johnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. == Post shōgunate == Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him.

The album was released on 25 May 2018 through Tiny Daggers. The album was supported by the singles \"Chin Up\", \"Keep It Simple\", and \"Promises\".\n\n== Background ==\nHutchison began writing the album in 2017, following the release of his debut album Slow Motion in 2016. The album explores themes of love, loss, and personal growth. Hutchison worked with producer Paul Epworth on the album, who has previously worked with artists such as Adele, Coldplay, and The Chemical Brothers.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe album received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic gave the album a rating of 4.5 stars. The album received a rating of four from Dork reviewer Felicity Newton, who described it as \"a record that's both timeless and perfectly timed\" and \"the work of an artist who's mastered the art of turning personal history into shared experience.\" Pitchfork's Olivia Horn rated the album 7.3, noting \"not everything is quite so grim\" and \"the bright, nostalgic pop palette McRae deploys across the album to help counterbalance its weightier material.\" It was given a rating score of 68% by Spectrum Culture, which commented, \"Thematically, the album leans into the idea of imperfections. Thus, the tracks that lyrically and sonically capture the romantic notion of flaws are destined to have a lasting effect.\" Writing for Hot Press with a rating of 8.5, Caroline Kelly opined, \"Driving a heavy force of heartbreak and rebuilding, I Don't Know How finds the singer at the intersection where Taylor Swift's Red and Joni Mitchell's Blue collide.\" == Track listing == == References ==\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

She is responsible for the education of approximately 12,000 students located at 25 elementary and middle schools, and employs over 2,000 staff, teachers, and administrators. Toenjes has a three year contract until June 30, 2027 with a base annual salary of $220,000. She has been with the Kyrene school district since 2016 joining when Dr. Jan Vesely became superintendent. After Vesely announced retirement in October 2020, the school board immediately promoted Toenjes to the superintendent role. Her career has also included positions at Sunnyside Unified School District and Arizona Department of Education. == Notable decisions == In February 2025, the Kyrene Governing Board created the Long Range Planning Committee. Toenjes was involved, and vetted 58 members of the committee. As of October 1, 2025, the planning committee is recommending closing 9 out of 25 schools, with final school board decision scheduled for December 2025. In April 2025, Toenjes re-affirmed that the school district's \"policies around equity, inclusion and social-emotional wellness—are fully compliant with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne threatened to withhold $1.5 million of federal funding per guidance from the United States Department of Education. The guidance was subsequently revoked, and district was properly funded. == References == \n\n<budget:token_budget>200000</budget:token_budget>\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

AllMusic gave the album a rating of 4.5 stars. The album received a rating of four from Dork reviewer Felicity Newton, who described it as \"a record that's both timeless and perfectly timed\" and \"the work of an artist who's mastered the art of turning personal history into shared experience.\" Pitchfork's Olivia Horn rated the album 7.3, noting \"not everything is quite so grim\" and \"the bright, nostalgic pop palette McRae deploys across the album to help counterbalance its weightier material.\" It was given a rating score of 68% by Spectrum Culture, which commented, \"Thematically, the album leans into the idea of imperfections.

It is located in the Mitte district and covers an area of 210 hectares (520 acres). The park was originally established in the 16th century as a hunting ground for the Prussian royal family. Today, it serves as a major recreational area for both locals and tourists.\n\nThe park features several notable landmarks and attractions, including the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building, and the Victory Column. It also contains numerous walking paths, gardens, and open spaces for relaxation and leisure activities. The Tiergarten is home to a variety of flora and fauna, making it an important green space in the heart of Berlin.\n\nIn recent years, the park has undergone significant renovations and improvements to enhance its accessibility and appeal to visitors. Various cultural events and festivals are held throughout the year, attracting thousands of people from around the world. The Tiergarten remains a symbol of Berlin's rich history and cultural heritage.\n\nHumboldthain is a public park in Berlin-Wedding, in the northwest of the city. It covers 33 hectares (82 acres) and is the second-largest park in Wedding. The park is notable for containing a World War II flak tower (Flakturm), which is one of Berlin's most distinctive historical structures.\n\n== History ==\n=== Nazi era ===\nIn 1869, the area was designated as a public park. During World War II, two massive concrete flak towers (anti-aircraft gun towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs. After 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits. From the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section. === Recent decades === Informal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

Godfrey is concerned that society consumes and disposes of too much waste, and that the majority of that ends up in landfill. Waste disposal typically occurs at uncontrolled dumpsites, and South Africa is decades behind other developed countries in how they handle waste. She has helped local, regional and international circular economy initiatives. She led the development and implementation of the Waste Research, Development and Innovation roadmap, which advocates for the uses science, technology and innovation in decision making.

The film was released in France on April 23, 2025, and will be broadcast on Ciné+ OCS on April 23, 2025. == Reception == A review on the website wired.it reads, \"The director of cult films such as Nikita, The Fifth Element, Léon, and Dogman returns with a work focused on the urgency of breaking free from the daily grind and enjoying life. He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\" A review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production.

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References ==\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

She worked with producer Jack Antonoff on the album, who has previously worked with artists including Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey, and The National.

The album received a rating of four from Dork reviewer Felicity Newton, who described it as \"a record that's both timeless and perfectly timed\" and \"the work of an artist who's mastered the art of turning personal history into shared experience.\" Pitchfork's Olivia Horn rated the album 7.3, noting \"not everything is quite so grim\" and \"the bright, nostalgic pop palette McRae deploys across the album to help counterbalance its weightier material.\" It was given a rating score of 68% by Spectrum Culture, which commented, \"Thematically, the album leans into the idea of imperfections. Thus, the tracks that lyrically and sonically capture the romantic notion of flaws are destined to have a lasting effect.\" Writing for Hot Press with a rating of 8.5, Caroline Kelly opined, \"Driving a heavy force of heartbreak and rebuilding, I Don't Know How finds the singer at the intersection where Taylor Swift's Red and Joni Mitchell's Blue collide.\" == Track listing == == References ==\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}
