John is encouraged by June to change his life and seek excitement outside of the office. June continues to push him beyond the limits of his comfort, ultimately leading him into a crime spree and on the run from the police.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in lockdown in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on April 17, 2025, followed by its broadcast on Ciné+ OCS on April 23, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA review on the website wired.it reads, \"The director of cult films such as Nikita, The Fifth Element, Léon, and Dogman returns with a work focused on the urgency of breaking free from the daily grind and enjoying life. He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study.

Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500.

With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T.

R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine.

Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In Japan, Tesco Boy saw massive success as a sire and became a major part of the Japanese horse racing bloodline. In six different years, Tesco Boy was the leading sire in Japan and his offspring would win nearly all of Japan's major races.

Tosho Boy himself also became a successful sire after his racing career. As a broodmare sire, Tesco Boy was also highly successful, with his daughters producing such successful race horses as Ines Fujin, the 1990 Tōkyō Yūshun winner, Trot Thunder, the 1996 Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship winner, and Nehai Caesar, the 1994 Autumn Tenno Sho winner.

The album starts with a clip from the '70s hockey movie that gave Slapshot their band name.\nThe album title is a reference to multiple things: it nods to hockey, Boston’s Revolutionary War–themed tourist culture, and to the idea that their hardcore sound was already considered old-fashioned at the time.\nAt the time of the albums release various reports stated lead singer disbanded the group the day after the albums release citing “the idiocy of a scene that is increasingly predominated by college frat boys who will mosh to anything that even closely resembles punk.” However the group still went on tours and eventually released a compilation album in 2001.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nGerman music review Visions.de wrote \"Olde Tyme Hardcore\" contains nothing really new; in just 27 minutes, the Boston band manages to present their entire understanding of hardcore. What's nice about it is their simple and honest style, which always lets you know where you stand right away.\"\nJoachim Hiller of Ox-fanzine gave the album a positive review stating “Musically, little has changed in the nine songs here: straightforward, brutal Sturm & Drang core in the familiar SLAPSHOT style.” Adding “ The album title and lyrics of the title track, demonstrate what the Boston band thinks of people who think SLAPSHOT's best days are behind them.”\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSlapshot\n\nJack \"Choke\" Kelly – lead vocals\nMike Bowser – guitar\nChris Lauria – bass\nMark Mckay – drums\nTechnical personnel\n\nArthur Johnston — composer\nRudy De Doncker — photography\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

It was included on Tsai's tenth studio album, Butterfly (2009). The track is an adaptation of the song of the same name by Lexington Bridge, originally written by Jonas Jeberg, Mikkel Sigvardt, Mich Hansen, and Nina Woodford. The Chinese lyrics were written by Issac Chen, with production by Adia. The song was released as a single on March 9, 2009, by Warner.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nOn July 4, 2008, Tsai's manager, Howard Chiang, revealed that she would begin recording her new album in August.

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

The performance, attended by one of the festival's largest crowds, was noted for its political themes and was described as the most significant concert of her 2025 tour by her entourage.

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

In 2024, he wrote an autobiography recounting his childhood in a city divided by the Berlin Wall, and his decision to move to New York City as soon as he turned 18.\nIn early 2001, Van Dijk founded the aid organization HOKISA (Homes for Kids in South Africa) in a town near Cape Town. His partners in the NGO mostly were South African activists. HOKISA provides support for children and young people who have lost their parents to AIDS or who are themselves HIV-positive. The first HOKISA home opened near Cape Town in 2002.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nVan Dijk was nominated in 2021 for the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, and in 2023, he was a nominee at the Stonewall Awards for his LGBTQ+ activism. In 1997, Van Dijk was awarded with the Youth Literature Award of Namibia and, in 2001, he received the Gustav Heinemann Peace Prize.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It resembles M. aurigera but lacks atranorin and tends to have larger spores.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was introduced as Malmidea coralliformis by Klaus Kalb in 2011 as part of a study establishing Malmidea and its family Malmideaceae. The holotype was collected in Thailand, Chiang Mai province, Doi Suthep–Pui National Park at about 700 m elevation, in a humid Dipterocarpus forest. The epithet coralliformis refers to the conspicuous, partly ramified, coral-like warts on the thallus.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus forms a thin, crust-like growth (about 50–70 μm thick) on bark and is densely warted (verrucose), with individual warts about 0.2–0.3 mm high and 0.1–0.3 mm wide that often coalesce and branch; soredia and isidia are absent. The medulla is whitish and reacts K+ (orange). Apothecia (the spore-producing discs) are sessile, rounded and 0.7–1.1 mm in diameter; the disc is brown to dark grey-brown with a thin, biatorine margin of the granifera type. The rim tissue (proper exciple) is hyaline peripherally and internally shows a medullary layer of loosely arranged, periclinally arranged hyphae bearing hydrophobic granules that partly dissolve in potassium hydroxide solution with a greenish-yellow reaction. The subhymenium is brown, the hypothecium (tissue beneath the hymenium) is blackish-brown and K–, and the hymenium is 75–100 μm high. Asci are 60–70 × 13–15 μm. Ascospores number 6–8 per ascus, are colourless, ellipsoid, non-septate and halonate, measuring 10–17 × 6–10 μm. The authors report several unknown xantholepinones as the detectable chemistry and note the absence of atranorin.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe species is known from northern Thailand (Chiang Mai province), where it grows on tree bark in humid evergreen Dipterocarpus forest around 700 m elevation.

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields.\n\n\n== References =="}

Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In Japan, Tesco Boy saw massive success as a sire and became a major part of the Japanese horse racing bloodline. In six different years, Tesco Boy was the leading sire in Japan and his offspring would win nearly all of Japan's major races. Included among his most notable progeny are Kitano Kachidoki, Tosho Boy, Tesco Gaby, and Hagino Kamui O, all of whom won major races that would later be considered Grade 1 when grading was introduced to horse racing. Tosho Boy himself also became a successful sire after his racing career. As a broodmare sire, Tesco Boy was also highly successful, with his daughters producing such successful race horses as Ines Fujin, the 1990 Tōkyō Yūshun winner, Trot Thunder, the 1996 Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship winner, and Nehai Caesar, the 1994 Autumn Tenno Sho winner. He is also the grandsire of Mr. C.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

On January 29, 2009, reports suggested that the album would be released by late March, and on February 27, 2009, it was revealed that Tsai would collaborate with newcomer Nick Chou on a duet.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Real Man\" adapts Lexington Bridge's track of the same name and is performed as a duet with Nick Chou. Musically, it blends dance-pop and hip-hop elements, while lyrically expressing a modern woman's expectations of an ideal partner.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Real Man\" premiered on March 8, 2009, during a launch event in Beijing that reportedly cost NT$850,000. Directed by Marlboro Lai and choreographed by Jonte' Moaning, the video features sharp dance sequences and an urban visual aesthetic.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe song reached number 25 on Taiwan's Hit FM Top 100 Singles of 2009 chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nNetEase Entertainment described \"Real Man\" as a standout adaptation distinguished by its rap sections, which were considered stronger than those in the original version. The review also noted the track's smooth and accessible sound. Smart Info praised the song's powerful opening, comparing it to a musical version of Sex and the City, and highlighted its lyrical exploration of the search for a \"perfect man\". The review also commended Nick Chou's raw yet sensual rap performance for adding balance to the song's structure.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOn May 3, 2009, \"Real Man\" won Most Popular Mandarin Song at the first round of the J. S. G. Selections. On August 9, 2009, it received the Mandarin Dance Song Award at the Metro Radio Mandarin Hits Music Awards. On January 23, 2010, it won Best Dance Song and was listed among the Top 20 Songs at the My Astro Music Awards. On January 31, 2010, it was named one of the Top 10 Songs of 2009 at the Baidu Boiling Point Awards, and later that year, it was recognized as one of the Top 10 Mandarin Songs of the Year at the Hito Music Awards.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nTsai performed \"Real Man\" on April 2, 2009, on the Anhui Television's variety show Star Magic. She sang the song again on April 5, 2009, on the Hunan Television's program Happy Camp. The track was later included in her live set at the Music Radio China Top Chart Awards on April 26, 2009. On May 2, 2009, she performed it at the J. S. G. Selections, followed by another performance at the Metro Radio Mandarin Hits Music Awards on August 9, 2009.

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids.\n\n\n== Preparation and reactions ==\nHydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid:\n\nHgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O\nEvaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate.\nThe anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide.\nSolutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2.

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals.

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

Together with her brother, Jeez Suave, she decided to pursue a career in music full-time, a choice her parents agreed to support on the condition that she succeed.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThéodora's earliest release on Spotify, a trap-pop project titled Neptune, appeared in 2021. She later gained wider recognition with the single \"Le Paradis se trouve dans le 9.3,\" whose video she financed with savings from a job at McDonald's.\nIn 2023, Théodora released two extended plays: Lili Aux Paradis Artificiels, a six-track project that included \"Le Paradis se trouve dans le 93,\" and Tome 2.\nThéodora's single \"Kongolese sous BBL,\" released on 27 September 2024, went viral on TikTok and became her breakthrough track. The Fader described the song as having \"palpable energy\" and \"hilarious\" songwriting. The single was certified diamond by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique on 3 July 2025, nine months after its release.\nIn November 2024, Théodora issued her first mixtape, Bad Boy Lovestory, described by The Fader as a \"sugary fizz of dance, electronic, dancehall, and more.\" The mixtape was followed by a deluxe version, Mega BBL, released in May 2025 and featuring collaborations with Chilly Gonzales, Juliette Armanet, Jul and Luidji. In August 2025, Mega BBL was certified platinum in France, representing over 100,000 units sold.\nOn 13 May, at the 2025 edition of Les Flammes, an awards ceremony dedicated to French rap and R&B, Théodora performed a medley of her songs \"Fashion Designa\" and \"Do U Wanna\". She received the award for \"Best Female Revelation,\" notably for \"Kongolese sous BBL\".\nIn June 2025, Théodora sold out three consecutive concerts at Zénith Paris, and her album Mega BBL was certified gold. Throughout the summer, she performed at major French festivals including Yardland, Les Vieilles Charrues, and Cabaret Vert. In August, Le Monde described her as the \"pop phenomenon of the summer\" and noted that with the success of her inclusive songs, she had become \"the new boss of pop in France.\" That month, Billboard France reported that Théodora was the second most-streamed female francophone artist of the year in France, behind Aya Nakamura.\nOn 12 September 2025, Théodora performed on the Angela Davis stage at the Fête de l'Humanité in La Courneuve. The performance, attended by one of the festival's largest crowds, was noted for its political themes and was described as the most significant concert of her 2025 tour by her entourage. Later that month, she and her album Bad Boy Lovestory received the 18–20 prize, organized by the Prix Joséphine des artistes in collaboration with Télérama, Crédit Mutuel, and National Center of Music. The award is decided by a jury of thirteen young music enthusiasts.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nThéodora's style has been described as a mix of goth, rap, and R&B influences. Her brother, Jeez Suave, serves as her main producer. Together they have incorporated elements of drum and bass, Creole folk music, Caribbean genres such as bouyon, and influences from her childhood spent in Greece, the Republic of the Congo, and Réunion.

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

The specific epithet refers to the conspicuous thallus warts, which look like tiny inflated balloons.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus is thin, crust-like and continuous (about 150–200 μm thick) on bark, densely warted (verrucose) with warts 0.2–0.3 mm high and 0.2–0.3 mm wide; soredia and isidia are absent. The medulla is whitish and reacts potassium hydroxide (KOH)-positive (orange). The photobiont is chlorococcoid, with cells 5–8 μm in diameter. Apothecia are sessile, rounded and 0.7–1 mm across and 0.3–0.4 mm high; the disc is plane to slightly convex, dark brown to blackish, and bordered by a thin biatorine margin of the granifera type that is 20–40 μm thick, initially entire and slightly prominent but tending to become recurved with age; the margin ranges from grey to dark brownish or blackish. The proper exciple is hyaline at the periphery and internally shows a medullary layer with only a few hydrophobic granules that dissolve in KOH without a distinct colour reaction. The subhymenium is about 10 μm high and olive-brown, the epihymenium about 25 μm and dark brown, the hymenium 75–100 μm and hyaline, and the hypothecium 100–170 μm and blackish-brown, with a  K– reaction. Asci measure 65–80 × 10–15 μm. Ascospores number 6–8 (occasionally as few as 4) per ascus, are colourless, ellipsoid, non-septate and halonate, 10–13 (more rarely up to 17) × 6–8 μm with an approximately 1-μm halo. Reported chemistry includes atranorin (major) with several as-yet unidentified lichen substances (minor).\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nKnown from northern Thailand, the species grows on tree bark in evergreen montane forest near the Doi Mon Larn–Mae Kampong area east-south-east of Chiang Mai, where the canopy is dominated by Lithocarpus, Quercus and Castanopsis.\n\n\n== References =="}

Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In his first life, he was the foremost figure of the cultivation world, a character marked by ambition, competitiveness, and arrogance who exhausted himself in ceaseless rivalry. Granted a second chance at life and armed with prior knowledge, he resolves to drift through existence as a carefree 'salted fish' (a euphemism for someone who wishes to 'lie flat'), adopting a detached outlook and devoting much of his energy to tending his crops. Yet, by chance, he gathers a circle of steadfast companions and is unwillingly drawn into sectarian conflict.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness.

Muñoz would help bring home the team's first Owners’ Championship in the 2024 ARCA Menards Series West. \nIn 2025, Muñoz would remain full time at CCR, being the crew chief for Tanner Reif in the No. 13 car. On April 5th, he would gain another win at Tucson Speedway after Tanner Reif would bring home his first win for Central Coast Racing.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMuñoz was born into a Latino family in California. He credits NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champion Matt Crafton as the reason he got into motorsports professionally. He met Crafton while growing up as a kid in second grade at school. In an interview, he says, \"Crafton gave me a platform as a child to dream, his dad, watching him be a mechanic during the day and a race mechanic at night.

It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened.\nNorthwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011.\nUnion Street Elementary was built in 1962.

{"title": "Eduard Johnson", "pageid": 81244720, "words": 853, "extract": "Wilhelm August Eduard Johnson (February 16, 1840 – September 7, 1903) was a German classicist, teacher, journalist and local historian. He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "444 East 58th Street", "pageid": 81245652, "words": 2476, "extract": "444 East 58th Street is a six-story Beaux-Arts architecture residential cooperative in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In the end, to protect the land and people he cherishes, he reluctantly returns to cultivation (advancing through successive levels of strength and facing heavenly tribulations), leading his comrades to shoulder the burden of salvation through his very being.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Main cast ===\nDylan Wang as Song Qianji\nLi Qin as Miao Yan\nRong Zishan as Meng Heze\n\n\n=== Supporting cast ===\nWang Duo as Wei Zhenyu\nZhang Yaqin as He Qingqing\nXia Meng as Chen Hongzhu\nTong Mengshi as Ziye Wenshu\nWu Xize as Yuan Qingshi\nYe Shengjia as Ji Chen\n\n\n== Production ==\nProduction for the series began in Hengdian World Studios in late April, with the series officially announced in mid-May at the Hunan Satellite TV & Mango TV industry conference.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu.

An elementary school was built to the east of it, and the high school was built to the north of the elementary on the west side of Hall Street in 1923.\nThe West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened.\nNorthwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011.\nUnion Street Elementary was built in 1962.

Warren Holmes Co. was the architect.\nThe opening of the high school was marred by vandalism. A few days prior to the first football game of the year, a match with Charlotte High School, students from Charlotte spray painted \"CHS\" on the school and smashed school bus windows.

Eaton Rapids won the football game against Charlotte 21-6.\nThe middle school and intermediate school share a building that opened in 1971.

In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided.

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "444 East 58th Street", "pageid": 81245652, "words": 2476, "extract": "444 East 58th Street is a six-story Beaux-Arts architecture residential cooperative in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids.\n\n\n== Preparation and reactions ==\nHydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid:\n\nHgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O\nEvaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate.\nThe anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide.\nSolutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex.\nMercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate:\n\nHg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions.\nThe anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nMercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu.

Established in 2020, the club positions itself as a pathway project combining grassroots development, community engagement, and global visibility for Nigerian players.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for Anioma Sporting emerged in 2020 under the leadership of Nigerian tech and automotive entrepreneur Qriss-Henry Ogwu. In September 2025, the club publicly announced its official launch with a stated mission to identify, develop, and showcase footballers from Delta North and across Nigeria. At launch, the club adopted blue and gold as its colours and the sobriquet \"Flagship of the River Niger\".\n\n\n== Vision and mission ==\nAnioma Sporting describes its vision as bridging the gap between raw talent and opportunity through:\n\nGrassroots and academy development (U10 to senior levels) with modern coaching and educational support;\nExposure and placement via performance analytics and video-based player profiles;\nCommunity engagement through tournaments and outreach within Delta State;\nAdoption of professional standards in player care, conditioning, and coaching;\nBuilding partnerships domestically and internationally to create onward opportunities for players.\n\n\n== Academy and player pathways ==\nThe club’s academy model centres on open trials and \"combine\" events in Delta North, age-group squads (U10–U19), and a development pipeline intended to prepare players for the senior game. The approach includes mentorship, conditioning, and showcasing players to scouts and clubs using match video and data profiles.\n\n\n== Stadium and facilities ==\nIn 2025, the club announced plans to use the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba as its official match and training facility as part of its long-term player development and community programmes. Anioma Sporting FC has also publicly indicated the stadium as a possible home ground in the near future.\n\n\n== Identity ==\nColours: Blue and Gold.\nMotto/Nickname: \"Flagship of the River Niger\".\n\n\n== Ownership and leadership ==\nThe project is credited to founder and principal Henry Ogwu. Further details of the board, management, and technical staff were not publicly disclosed at the time of launch in 2025.\n\n\n== Challenges and prospects ==\nAnalysts and local coverage have noted typical challenges for new Nigerian clubs, including infrastructure, financing, and competition for talent and visibility. Proponents argue that the emphasis on technology, community engagement, and international pathways could provide a replicable model for regional academies if sustained over time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNigeria Football Federation\nYouth football in Nigeria\nStephen Keshi Stadium\nList of football clubs in Nigeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAnioma Sporting FC coverage at [1]"}

In Eaton County, it serves Eaton Rapids and parts of the townships of Brookfield, Eaton, Eaton Rapids, Hamlin, and Windsor. In Ingham County, it serves parts of the townships of Aurelius, Delhi, and Onondaga.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first commencement at Eaton Rapids High School was in 1875.\nA brick school was built in 1886 on the north side of King Street near the end of West Street. It was ultimately known as the West Building. An elementary school was built to the east of it, and the high school was built to the north of the elementary on the west side of Hall Street in 1923.\nThe West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened.\nNorthwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011.\nUnion Street Elementary was built in 1962. The architect was Guido A. Binda. Currently it is known as Union Street Center and houses the Early Learning Center and other programs for the community.\nThe current high school opened in fall 1963. Warren Holmes Co. was the architect.\nThe opening of the high school was marred by vandalism. A few days prior to the first football game of the year, a match with Charlotte High School, students from Charlotte spray painted \"CHS\" on the school and smashed school bus windows. The guilty boys agreed to pay for the clean-up and did not face prosecution. Eaton Rapids won the football game against Charlotte 21-6.\nThe middle school and intermediate school share a building that opened in 1971. The name \"Intermediate\" was chosen instead of \"Junior High\" because, as then superintendent Carl Holbrook said, \"The word 'junior' gives connotations of secondary importance. We don't want our new school to be junior anything.\"\nParts of the former high school have been converted into apartments.\n\n\n== Schools ==\nThe district's schools share a campus on State Street/Plains Road at Greyhound Drive.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEaton Rapids Public Schools"}

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

He served at posts throughout the United States, and was a graduate of the Army School of the Line, United States Army Command and General Staff College, and United States Army War College.\nRees became known for his abilities as a trainer and educator; at the start of World War I, he organized and led the Student Army Training Corps. During the war, he chaired the United States Department of War's Education and Training Committee, which created training programs for soldiers and introduced vocational training in anticipation of discharged soldiers needing employment in a post-war economy. He subsequently served in France, where he organized and led the American Expeditionary Forces University, which provided education and training to soldiers prior to their discharges as a way to facilitate their return to the workforce after the war. Following his return to the United States, Rees was head of the War Department's Education and Recreation Branch and served as the U.S. veterans' bureau's assistant director for vocational rehabilitation.\nRees left the army in 1924 and became assistant vice president for personnel and public relations with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.

In 1895, he received the degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Engineer of Mining (E.M.) from the Michigan College of Mines (now Michigan Technological University). He studied at Harvard University and New York Law School before deciding on a military career.\nOn 7 May 1897, Rees enlisted in the United States Army, joining Company B of the Battalion of Engineers as a corporal. The Spanish–American War started in April 1898, and Rees performed duties associated with defense of strategically valuable waterways. In May 1898, Rees was one of eight soldiers who were run down by the French ocean liner SS La Touraine while they were laying mines in New York Harbor. The ship was putting out to sea, and did not stop or lower life boats, resulting in the drowning of two men. The other six, including Rees, were rescued. In November 1899, Rees was performing Philippine–American War Engineer duties in Malate, Philippines when he was notified that his application for a commission had been approved. He was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry, effective 25 October 1899.\n\n\n== Start of career ==\nRees was initially assigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and he continued to serve with his regiment in the Philippines.

In May 1912, Rees was posted to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was a student in the Army School of the Line. He completed the course in 1913, and was named a distinguished graduate.\n\n\n== Continued career ==\n\nAfter completing the School of the Line, Rees remained at Fort Leavenworth to attend the United States Army Command and General Staff College, from which he graduated in 1914. After completing the Staff College course, he joined the 3rd Infantry at Madison Barracks, New York. In 1916, Rees was assigned as commandant of cadets and professor of military science at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. Soon after American entry into World War I in April 1917, Rees was assigned to the Army General Staff, first as a member of the War Plans Division, then as a member of the Operations Division. In these roles, he was appointed chairman of the War Department Committee On Education and Special Training, which created training programs for mechanics and technicians. This effort proved successful, and Rees went on to create the wartime Student Army Training Corps, which encouraged young men to receive military training while attending college.\nRees subsequently served in France, where he organized and headed the American Expeditionary Forces University, a wartime and post-war effort to provide college courses and vocational training to soldiers in order to facilitate their transition to jobs and careers in the post-war economy.

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "444 East 58th Street", "pageid": 81245652, "words": 2476, "extract": "444 East 58th Street is a six-story Beaux-Arts architecture residential cooperative in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

While only moderately successful in racing, he became a major breeding sire in Japan in the 1970s and was on six occasions the leading sire in the country.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nTesco Boy was foaled in 1963. He was owned by Sir Jack Cohen, the founder of Tesco, who named the horse after the supermarket chain. As a race horse, Tesco Boy started in 11 races, winning five. His most notable result was a win in the 1966 Queen Anne Stakes, while also taking victories in lesser races, such as the Rose of York Stakes. He also placed in the Sussex Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Champion Stakes the same year.\nTesco Boy was retired from racing in 1967, and was initially sent to stud in Ireland. At the end of 1967, he was exported to Japan to stand stud at the Hidaka Light Stallion Agricultural Cooperative's Monbestu Stud Farm in the Hokkaido region. In Japan, Tesco Boy saw massive success as a sire and became a major part of the Japanese horse racing bloodline. In six different years, Tesco Boy was the leading sire in Japan and his offspring would win nearly all of Japan's major races. Included among his most notable progeny are Kitano Kachidoki, Tosho Boy, Tesco Gaby, and Hagino Kamui O, all of whom won major races that would later be considered Grade 1 when grading was introduced to horse racing. Tosho Boy himself also became a successful sire after his racing career. As a broodmare sire, Tesco Boy was also highly successful, with his daughters producing such successful race horses as Ines Fujin, the 1990 Tōkyō Yūshun winner, Trot Thunder, the 1996 Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship winner, and Nehai Caesar, the 1994 Autumn Tenno Sho winner. He is also the grandsire of Mr. C. B., who won the Japanese Triple Crown in 1983.\nAnother of Tesco Boy's grandsons, Sakura Bakushin O, became a successful sire in his own right, and Tesco Boy's bloodline continues in the 21st century mainly through descendants of Sakura Bakushin O.

Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids.\n\n\n== Preparation and reactions ==\nHydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid:\n\nHgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O\nEvaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate.\nThe anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide.\nSolutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex.\nMercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate:\n\nHg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions.\nThe anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nMercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines.\n\n\n== References =="}

It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

John is encouraged by June to change his life and seek excitement outside of the office. June continues to push him beyond the limits of his comfort, ultimately leading him into a crime spree and on the run from the police.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in lockdown in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on April 17, 2025, followed by its broadcast on Ciné+ OCS on April 23, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA review on the website wired.it reads, \"The director of cult films such as Nikita, The Fifth Element, Léon, and Dogman returns with a work focused on the urgency of breaking free from the daily grind and enjoying life. He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

In Eaton County, it serves Eaton Rapids and parts of the townships of Brookfield, Eaton, Eaton Rapids, Hamlin, and Windsor. In Ingham County, it serves parts of the townships of Aurelius, Delhi, and Onondaga.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first commencement at Eaton Rapids High School was in 1875.\nA brick school was built in 1886 on the north side of King Street near the end of West Street. It was ultimately known as the West Building. An elementary school was built to the east of it, and the high school was built to the north of the elementary on the west side of Hall Street in 1923.\nThe West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened.\nNorthwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011.\nUnion Street Elementary was built in 1962. The architect was Guido A. Binda. Currently it is known as Union Street Center and houses the Early Learning Center and other programs for the community.\nThe current high school opened in fall 1963. Warren Holmes Co. was the architect.\nThe opening of the high school was marred by vandalism. A few days prior to the first football game of the year, a match with Charlotte High School, students from Charlotte spray painted \"CHS\" on the school and smashed school bus windows. The guilty boys agreed to pay for the clean-up and did not face prosecution. Eaton Rapids won the football game against Charlotte 21-6.\nThe middle school and intermediate school share a building that opened in 1971. The name \"Intermediate\" was chosen instead of \"Junior High\" because, as then superintendent Carl Holbrook said, \"The word 'junior' gives connotations of secondary importance. We don't want our new school to be junior anything.\"\nParts of the former high school have been converted into apartments.\n\n\n== Schools ==\nThe district's schools share a campus on State Street/Plains Road at Greyhound Drive.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEaton Rapids Public Schools"}

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

Rees attained the rank of brigadier general, and was a recipient of the Army Distinguished Service Medal and Officer of the French Legion of Honor.\nA native of Houghton, Michigan and an 1895 graduate of Michigan Technological University, Rees enlisted in the United States Army in 1897 and served during the Spanish–American War. He received his commission in 1899 while serving in the Philippine–American War, and began his career as a member of the 3rd Infantry Regiment. He served at posts throughout the United States, and was a graduate of the Army School of the Line, United States Army Command and General Staff College, and United States Army War College.\nRees became known for his abilities as a trainer and educator; at the start of World War I, he organized and led the Student Army Training Corps. During the war, he chaired the United States Department of War's Education and Training Committee, which created training programs for soldiers and introduced vocational training in anticipation of discharged soldiers needing employment in a post-war economy. He subsequently served in France, where he organized and led the American Expeditionary Forces University, which provided education and training to soldiers prior to their discharges as a way to facilitate their return to the workforce after the war. Following his return to the United States, Rees was head of the War Department's Education and Recreation Branch and served as the U.S. veterans' bureau's assistant director for vocational rehabilitation.\nRees left the army in 1924 and became assistant vice president for personnel and public relations with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.

He experienced a cerebral hemorrhage while in Detroit on 18 November. he died in a Detroit hospital on 23 November and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRobert Irwin Rees was born in Houghton, Michigan on 9 November 1871, a son of Seth Rees and Eugenia (Livermore) Rees. Among his siblings was Thomas H. Rees, who also served as a US Army brigadier general. He was raised and educated in Houghton and was a graduate of Houghton High School. In 1895, he received the degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Engineer of Mining (E.M.) from the Michigan College of Mines (now Michigan Technological University). He studied at Harvard University and New York Law School before deciding on a military career.\nOn 7 May 1897, Rees enlisted in the United States Army, joining Company B of the Battalion of Engineers as a corporal. The Spanish–American War started in April 1898, and Rees performed duties associated with defense of strategically valuable waterways. In May 1898, Rees was one of eight soldiers who were run down by the French ocean liner SS La Touraine while they were laying mines in New York Harbor. The ship was putting out to sea, and did not stop or lower life boats, resulting in the drowning of two men. The other six, including Rees, were rescued. In November 1899, Rees was performing Philippine–American War Engineer duties in Malate, Philippines when he was notified that his application for a commission had been approved. He was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry, effective 25 October 1899.\n\n\n== Start of career ==\nRees was initially assigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and he continued to serve with his regiment in the Philippines. In February 1902, he led the effort that recovered the bodies of five soldiers from the 35th U.S. Volunteer Infantry, who had been ambushed in 1900 while providing an escort for a pro-U.S. local leader. After returning to the United States in 1903, he was posted to Kentucky, stationed first at Fort Thomas and later at West Point. Following his service in Kentucky, Rees was assigned to duty in Alaska Territory, where he initially served at Fort Liscum, then at Fort Egbert.\nIn June 1907, Rees was assigned to Fort Columbia, Washington, where he served as an instructor for joint army and National Guard coastal defense exercises. In the summer of 1908, he commanded Company H, 3rd Infantry during a temporary camp near Tacoma, Washington, where army units conducted extensive maneuvers and exercises to gain proficiency with Field Artillery gunnery and Infantry and Cavalry attacks and defenses. After returning to Fort Columbia later that year, he served as adjutant of the 3rd Infantry. In September 1909, Rees returned to the Philippines, where he served with the 3rd Infantry on the island of Jolo. In May 1912, Rees was posted to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was a student in the Army School of the Line. He completed the course in 1913, and was named a distinguished graduate.\n\n\n== Continued career ==\n\nAfter completing the School of the Line, Rees remained at Fort Leavenworth to attend the United States Army Command and General Staff College, from which he graduated in 1914. After completing the Staff College course, he joined the 3rd Infantry at Madison Barracks, New York. In 1916, Rees was assigned as commandant of cadets and professor of military science at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. Soon after American entry into World War I in April 1917, Rees was assigned to the Army General Staff, first as a member of the War Plans Division, then as a member of the Operations Division. In these roles, he was appointed chairman of the War Department Committee On Education and Special Training, which created training programs for mechanics and technicians. This effort proved successful, and Rees went on to create the wartime Student Army Training Corps, which encouraged young men to receive military training while attending college.\nRees subsequently served in France, where he organized and headed the American Expeditionary Forces University, a wartime and post-war effort to provide college courses and vocational training to soldiers in order to facilitate their transition to jobs and careers in the post-war economy. After returning to the United States, Rees was assigned as chief of the education and recreation branch of the War Plans Division. In 1922, he was detailed to the U.S. veterans' bureau as assistant director in charge of vocational rehabilitation. Later that year he was enrolled as a student in the United States Army War College, from which he graduated in 1923. In 1924, Rees retired from the military so he could begin a civilian career as a telecommunications executive.\n\n\n== Later career ==\n\nAfter leaving the army, Rees resided in New York City and joined the American Telephone and Telegraph Company as an assistant vice president. As head of the company's personnel and public relations departments, he had responsibility for employee development and manager training throughout the entire Bell Telephone System. He was a member of the American Association for Adult Education and the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education and was the society's president from 1929 to 1930. In addition, he was active in the Association of Cooperative Colleges, the City Club of New York, the Machinery Club of New York, and the Engineers' Club. Rees was also a member of the Army and Navy Club of Washington, D.C.\nRees's additional activities and memberships included the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Academy of Political Science, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He was also prominent with the Corporation of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Personnel Research Federation, and American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers. In November 1936, Rees resigned from AT&T, effective December 1, so he could take a position with the American Engineers' Council for Professional Development. He experienced a cerebral hemorrhage on 18 November while in Detroit to address a meeting of Engineering Society of Detroit. He died in a Detroit hospital on 23 November. Rees's funeral was held at the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in Manhattan and he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nFor his First World War service, Rees was a recipient of the Army Distinguished Service Medal. In addition, he was named an Officer of the Legion of Honor by the government of France.\n\n\n=== Distinguished Service Medal citation ===\nThe citation for Rees's Distinguished Service Medal read:\nFor exceptionally meritorious and conspicuous service with the committee charged with education and special training in the Army. To his initiative and breadth of vision are largely due the successful measures for training of enlisted men for special services and the establishment of the Students' Army Training Corps.\nOrders: War Department, General Orders No. 25 (1919)\n\n\n=== Additional awards ===\nRees was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1930 and Michigan Technological University in 1933.\n\n\n== Dates of rank ==\nRees's dates of rank were:\n\nCorporal, 7 May 1897\nSecond Lieutenant, 25 October 1899\nFirst Lieutenant, 9 April 1901\nCaptain, 11 March 1911\nMajor (National Army), 5 August 1917\nLieutenant Colonel (National Army), 5 August 1917\nMajor, 18 September 1917\nColonel (National Army), 27 July 1918\nBrigadier General (National Army), 1 October 1918\nColonel (National Army), 6 August 1919\nLieutenant Colonel, 1 July 1920\nLieutenant Colonel (Retired), 26 February 1924\nBrigadier General (Retired), 21 June 1930\n\n\n== Works by ==\nPersonnel Management.

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002).

It is also under development for the treatment of insomnia in humans. The drug is used as an oral solution in dogs, whereas its route of administration for humans is unspecified.\nThe drug acts as a potent and selective full agonist of the human α2A-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, it is a much weaker agonist of the rodent α2B-, α2C-, and α2D-adrenergic receptors. In addition, it shows only low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors, where it appears to act as a partial agonist. Tasipimidine produces anxiolytic, sedative, hypolocomotor, hypotensive, and bradycardic effects in animals.\nTasipimidine is under development for use in humans by Orion Corporation. As of October 2024, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for this indication. The drug is or was also under development for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in humans, but no recent development for this indication has been reported.

{"title": "444 East 58th Street", "pageid": 81245652, "words": 2476, "extract": "444 East 58th Street is a six-story Beaux-Arts architecture residential cooperative in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

While only moderately successful in racing, he became a major breeding sire in Japan in the 1970s and was on six occasions the leading sire in the country.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nTesco Boy was foaled in 1963. He was owned by Sir Jack Cohen, the founder of Tesco, who named the horse after the supermarket chain. As a race horse, Tesco Boy started in 11 races, winning five. His most notable result was a win in the 1966 Queen Anne Stakes, while also taking victories in lesser races, such as the Rose of York Stakes. He also placed in the Sussex Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Champion Stakes the same year.\nTesco Boy was retired from racing in 1967, and was initially sent to stud in Ireland. At the end of 1967, he was exported to Japan to stand stud at the Hidaka Light Stallion Agricultural Cooperative's Monbestu Stud Farm in the Hokkaido region. In Japan, Tesco Boy saw massive success as a sire and became a major part of the Japanese horse racing bloodline. In six different years, Tesco Boy was the leading sire in Japan and his offspring would win nearly all of Japan's major races. Included among his most notable progeny are Kitano Kachidoki, Tosho Boy, Tesco Gaby, and Hagino Kamui O, all of whom won major races that would later be considered Grade 1 when grading was introduced to horse racing. Tosho Boy himself also became a successful sire after his racing career. As a broodmare sire, Tesco Boy was also highly successful, with his daughters producing such successful race horses as Ines Fujin, the 1990 Tōkyō Yūshun winner, Trot Thunder, the 1996 Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship winner, and Nehai Caesar, the 1994 Autumn Tenno Sho winner. He is also the grandsire of Mr. C.

Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

Publications such as CooperatorNews and the New York Real Estate Journal document the role of the organization during his tenure.\n\n\n=== Properties and transactions ===\nLevites-affiliated entities owned or managed properties across the Bronx and Manhattan:\n\nIn 1982–84, Levites purchased and later transferred 444-446 East 58th Street, Sutton Place, into a cooperative corporation.\nIn 2015, his estate sold 225 Central Park North, a 49-unit rental, for $33 million.\nLevites Realty Management, LLC was also licensed as a principal office broker and engaged in property management across multiple Bronx sites.\n\n\n=== Press coverage ===\nLevites’ management drew coverage in local and trade outlets. In 2014, Bronx Times, Norwood News, and The Real Deal reported on steep rent hikes imposed at a Kingsbridge shopping plaza managed by Levites Realty Management; the increases were later frozen following community pushback.\n\n\n== Litigation ==\nLevites and his companies were parties to several lawsuits:\n\nMartinez v. Levites Realty Management, LLC (Bronx Sup. Ct. 2018): premises liability at 2565 Grand Concourse.\nOsorio v. Louis Richardt Holdings LLC (2017): litigation naming Levites Realty entities in discovery.\nIn re Pradeep Thakur (S.D.N.Y. 2013): federal opinion detailing Levites’ lending operations.\nBaron Associates (Estate of Barry Levites & Ronald Rettner) v. David Leo (Westchester 2013): contract dispute over a Levites-connected partnership.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nIn 2011, Washington University in St. Louis dedicated the Barry H. Levites Chabad House, housing Chabad on Campus.\n\n\n== Death ==\nLevites died in May 2010. Paid death notices in The New York Times described him as a “real estate magnate” and community leader.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBronx–Manhattan North Association of Realtors\nReal estate in New York City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLevites Realty Management coverage in The Real Deal"}

They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites.

John is encouraged by June to change his life and seek excitement outside of the office. June continues to push him beyond the limits of his comfort, ultimately leading him into a crime spree and on the run from the police.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in lockdown in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on April 17, 2025, followed by its broadcast on Ciné+ OCS on April 23, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA review on the website wired.it reads, \"The director of cult films such as Nikita, The Fifth Element, Léon, and Dogman returns with a work focused on the urgency of breaking free from the daily grind and enjoying life. He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

The architect was Guido A. Binda. Currently it is known as Union Street Center and houses the Early Learning Center and other programs for the community.\nThe current high school opened in fall 1963. Warren Holmes Co. was the architect.\nThe opening of the high school was marred by vandalism. A few days prior to the first football game of the year, a match with Charlotte High School, students from Charlotte spray painted \"CHS\" on the school and smashed school bus windows. The guilty boys agreed to pay for the clean-up and did not face prosecution. Eaton Rapids won the football game against Charlotte 21-6.\nThe middle school and intermediate school share a building that opened in 1971. The name \"Intermediate\" was chosen instead of \"Junior High\" because, as then superintendent Carl Holbrook said, \"The word 'junior' gives connotations of secondary importance. We don't want our new school to be junior anything.\"\nParts of the former high school have been converted into apartments.\n\n\n== Schools ==\nThe district's schools share a campus on State Street/Plains Road at Greyhound Drive.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEaton Rapids Public Schools"}

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study.

Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

He was owned by Sir Jack Cohen, the founder of Tesco, who named the horse after the supermarket chain. As a race horse, Tesco Boy started in 11 races, winning five.

He also placed in the Sussex Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Champion Stakes the same year.\nTesco Boy was retired from racing in 1967, and was initially sent to stud in Ireland. At the end of 1967, he was exported to Japan to stand stud at the Hidaka Light Stallion Agricultural Cooperative's Monbestu Stud Farm in the Hokkaido region. In Japan, Tesco Boy saw massive success as a sire and became a major part of the Japanese horse racing bloodline. In six different years, Tesco Boy was the leading sire in Japan and his offspring would win nearly all of Japan's major races. Included among his most notable progeny are Kitano Kachidoki, Tosho Boy, Tesco Gaby, and Hagino Kamui O, all of whom won major races that would later be considered Grade 1 when grading was introduced to horse racing. Tosho Boy himself also became a successful sire after his racing career. As a broodmare sire, Tesco Boy was also highly successful, with his daughters producing such successful race horses as Ines Fujin, the 1990 Tōkyō Yūshun winner, Trot Thunder, the 1996 Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship winner, and Nehai Caesar, the 1994 Autumn Tenno Sho winner. He is also the grandsire of Mr. C.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids.\n\n\n== Preparation and reactions ==\nHydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid:\n\nHgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O\nEvaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate.\nThe anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide.\nSolutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2.

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

John is encouraged by June to change his life and seek excitement outside of the office. June continues to push him beyond the limits of his comfort, ultimately leading him into a crime spree and on the run from the police.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot in lockdown in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered at the Grand Rex in Paris on April 17, 2025, followed by its broadcast on Ciné+ OCS on April 23, 2025.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA review on the website wired.it reads, \"The director of cult films such as Nikita, The Fifth Element, Léon, and Dogman returns with a work focused on the urgency of breaking free from the daily grind and enjoying life. He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study.

Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500.

With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T.

R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States.

Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In Japan, Tesco Boy saw massive success as a sire and became a major part of the Japanese horse racing bloodline. In six different years, Tesco Boy was the leading sire in Japan and his offspring would win nearly all of Japan's major races. Included among his most notable progeny are Kitano Kachidoki, Tosho Boy, Tesco Gaby, and Hagino Kamui O, all of whom won major races that would later be considered Grade 1 when grading was introduced to horse racing. Tosho Boy himself also became a successful sire after his racing career. As a broodmare sire, Tesco Boy was also highly successful, with his daughters producing such successful race horses as Ines Fujin, the 1990 Tōkyō Yūshun winner, Trot Thunder, the 1996 Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship winner, and Nehai Caesar, the 1994 Autumn Tenno Sho winner. He is also the grandsire of Mr. C.

The album starts with a clip from the '70s hockey movie that gave Slapshot their band name.\nThe album title is a reference to multiple things: it nods to hockey, Boston’s Revolutionary War–themed tourist culture, and to the idea that their hardcore sound was already considered old-fashioned at the time.\nAt the time of the albums release various reports stated lead singer disbanded the group the day after the albums release citing “the idiocy of a scene that is increasingly predominated by college frat boys who will mosh to anything that even closely resembles punk.” However the group still went on tours and eventually released a compilation album in 2001.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nGerman music review Visions.de wrote \"Olde Tyme Hardcore\" contains nothing really new; in just 27 minutes, the Boston band manages to present their entire understanding of hardcore. What's nice about it is their simple and honest style, which always lets you know where you stand right away.\"\nJoachim Hiller of Ox-fanzine gave the album a positive review stating “Musically, little has changed in the nine songs here: straightforward, brutal Sturm & Drang core in the familiar SLAPSHOT style.” Adding “ The album title and lyrics of the title track, demonstrate what the Boston band thinks of people who think SLAPSHOT's best days are behind them.”\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSlapshot\n\nJack \"Choke\" Kelly – lead vocals\nMike Bowser – guitar\nChris Lauria – bass\nMark Mckay – drums\nTechnical personnel\n\nArthur Johnston — composer\nRudy De Doncker — photography\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

It was included on Tsai's tenth studio album, Butterfly (2009). The track is an adaptation of the song of the same name by Lexington Bridge, originally written by Jonas Jeberg, Mikkel Sigvardt, Mich Hansen, and Nina Woodford. The Chinese lyrics were written by Issac Chen, with production by Adia. The song was released as a single on March 9, 2009, by Warner.\n\n\n== Background and development ==\nOn July 4, 2008, Tsai's manager, Howard Chiang, revealed that she would begin recording her new album in August.

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

The performance, attended by one of the festival's largest crowds, was noted for its political themes and was described as the most significant concert of her 2025 tour by her entourage.

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

In 2024, he wrote an autobiography recounting his childhood in a city divided by the Berlin Wall, and his decision to move to New York City as soon as he turned 18.\nIn early 2001, Van Dijk founded the aid organization HOKISA (Homes for Kids in South Africa) in a town near Cape Town. His partners in the NGO mostly were South African activists. HOKISA provides support for children and young people who have lost their parents to AIDS or who are themselves HIV-positive. The first HOKISA home opened near Cape Town in 2002.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\nVan Dijk was nominated in 2021 for the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, and in 2023, he was a nominee at the Stonewall Awards for his LGBTQ+ activism. In 1997, Van Dijk was awarded with the Youth Literature Award of Namibia and, in 2001, he received the Gustav Heinemann Peace Prize.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It resembles M. aurigera but lacks atranorin and tends to have larger spores.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was introduced as Malmidea coralliformis by Klaus Kalb in 2011 as part of a study establishing Malmidea and its family Malmideaceae. The holotype was collected in Thailand, Chiang Mai province, Doi Suthep–Pui National Park at about 700 m elevation, in a humid Dipterocarpus forest. The epithet coralliformis refers to the conspicuous, partly ramified, coral-like warts on the thallus.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus forms a thin, crust-like growth (about 50–70 μm thick) on bark and is densely warted (verrucose), with individual warts about 0.2–0.3 mm high and 0.1–0.3 mm wide that often coalesce and branch; soredia and isidia are absent. The medulla is whitish and reacts K+ (orange). Apothecia (the spore-producing discs) are sessile, rounded and 0.7–1.1 mm in diameter; the disc is brown to dark grey-brown with a thin, biatorine margin of the granifera type. The rim tissue (proper exciple) is hyaline peripherally and internally shows a medullary layer of loosely arranged, periclinally arranged hyphae bearing hydrophobic granules that partly dissolve in potassium hydroxide solution with a greenish-yellow reaction. The subhymenium is brown, the hypothecium (tissue beneath the hymenium) is blackish-brown and K–, and the hymenium is 75–100 μm high. Asci are 60–70 × 13–15 μm. Ascospores number 6–8 per ascus, are colourless, ellipsoid, non-septate and halonate, measuring 10–17 × 6–10 μm. The authors report several unknown xantholepinones as the detectable chemistry and note the absence of atranorin.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nThe species is known from northern Thailand (Chiang Mai province), where it grows on tree bark in humid evergreen Dipterocarpus forest around 700 m elevation.

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields.\n\n\n== References =="}

Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In Japan, Tesco Boy saw massive success as a sire and became a major part of the Japanese horse racing bloodline. In six different years, Tesco Boy was the leading sire in Japan and his offspring would win nearly all of Japan's major races. Included among his most notable progeny are Kitano Kachidoki, Tosho Boy, Tesco Gaby, and Hagino Kamui O, all of whom won major races that would later be considered Grade 1 when grading was introduced to horse racing. Tosho Boy himself also became a successful sire after his racing career. As a broodmare sire, Tesco Boy was also highly successful, with his daughters producing such successful race horses as Ines Fujin, the 1990 Tōkyō Yūshun winner, Trot Thunder, the 1996 Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship winner, and Nehai Caesar, the 1994 Autumn Tenno Sho winner. He is also the grandsire of Mr. C.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

On January 29, 2009, reports suggested that the album would be released by late March, and on February 27, 2009, it was revealed that Tsai would collaborate with newcomer Nick Chou on a duet.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Real Man\" adapts Lexington Bridge's track of the same name and is performed as a duet with Nick Chou. Musically, it blends dance-pop and hip-hop elements, while lyrically expressing a modern woman's expectations of an ideal partner.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Real Man\" premiered on March 8, 2009, during a launch event in Beijing that reportedly cost NT$850,000. Directed by Marlboro Lai and choreographed by Jonte' Moaning, the video features sharp dance sequences and an urban visual aesthetic.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe song reached number 25 on Taiwan's Hit FM Top 100 Singles of 2009 chart.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nNetEase Entertainment described \"Real Man\" as a standout adaptation distinguished by its rap sections, which were considered stronger than those in the original version. The review also noted the track's smooth and accessible sound. Smart Info praised the song's powerful opening, comparing it to a musical version of Sex and the City, and highlighted its lyrical exploration of the search for a \"perfect man\". The review also commended Nick Chou's raw yet sensual rap performance for adding balance to the song's structure.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nOn May 3, 2009, \"Real Man\" won Most Popular Mandarin Song at the first round of the J. S. G. Selections. On August 9, 2009, it received the Mandarin Dance Song Award at the Metro Radio Mandarin Hits Music Awards. On January 23, 2010, it won Best Dance Song and was listed among the Top 20 Songs at the My Astro Music Awards. On January 31, 2010, it was named one of the Top 10 Songs of 2009 at the Baidu Boiling Point Awards, and later that year, it was recognized as one of the Top 10 Mandarin Songs of the Year at the Hito Music Awards.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nTsai performed \"Real Man\" on April 2, 2009, on the Anhui Television's variety show Star Magic. She sang the song again on April 5, 2009, on the Hunan Television's program Happy Camp. The track was later included in her live set at the Music Radio China Top Chart Awards on April 26, 2009. On May 2, 2009, she performed it at the J. S. G. Selections, followed by another performance at the Metro Radio Mandarin Hits Music Awards on August 9, 2009.

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids.\n\n\n== Preparation and reactions ==\nHydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid:\n\nHgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O\nEvaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate.\nThe anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide.\nSolutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2.

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals.

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness. Before her passing, she composed a death poem;\n\nOn the road where we parted waysThe lingering traces of our loveLike white snow on the roadside\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nShe is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky.

Together with her brother, Jeez Suave, she decided to pursue a career in music full-time, a choice her parents agreed to support on the condition that she succeed.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThéodora's earliest release on Spotify, a trap-pop project titled Neptune, appeared in 2021. She later gained wider recognition with the single \"Le Paradis se trouve dans le 9.3,\" whose video she financed with savings from a job at McDonald's.\nIn 2023, Théodora released two extended plays: Lili Aux Paradis Artificiels, a six-track project that included \"Le Paradis se trouve dans le 93,\" and Tome 2.\nThéodora's single \"Kongolese sous BBL,\" released on 27 September 2024, went viral on TikTok and became her breakthrough track. The Fader described the song as having \"palpable energy\" and \"hilarious\" songwriting. The single was certified diamond by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique on 3 July 2025, nine months after its release.\nIn November 2024, Théodora issued her first mixtape, Bad Boy Lovestory, described by The Fader as a \"sugary fizz of dance, electronic, dancehall, and more.\" The mixtape was followed by a deluxe version, Mega BBL, released in May 2025 and featuring collaborations with Chilly Gonzales, Juliette Armanet, Jul and Luidji. In August 2025, Mega BBL was certified platinum in France, representing over 100,000 units sold.\nOn 13 May, at the 2025 edition of Les Flammes, an awards ceremony dedicated to French rap and R&B, Théodora performed a medley of her songs \"Fashion Designa\" and \"Do U Wanna\". She received the award for \"Best Female Revelation,\" notably for \"Kongolese sous BBL\".\nIn June 2025, Théodora sold out three consecutive concerts at Zénith Paris, and her album Mega BBL was certified gold. Throughout the summer, she performed at major French festivals including Yardland, Les Vieilles Charrues, and Cabaret Vert. In August, Le Monde described her as the \"pop phenomenon of the summer\" and noted that with the success of her inclusive songs, she had become \"the new boss of pop in France.\" That month, Billboard France reported that Théodora was the second most-streamed female francophone artist of the year in France, behind Aya Nakamura.\nOn 12 September 2025, Théodora performed on the Angela Davis stage at the Fête de l'Humanité in La Courneuve. The performance, attended by one of the festival's largest crowds, was noted for its political themes and was described as the most significant concert of her 2025 tour by her entourage. Later that month, she and her album Bad Boy Lovestory received the 18–20 prize, organized by the Prix Joséphine des artistes in collaboration with Télérama, Crédit Mutuel, and National Center of Music. The award is decided by a jury of thirteen young music enthusiasts.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nThéodora's style has been described as a mix of goth, rap, and R&B influences. Her brother, Jeez Suave, serves as her main producer. Together they have incorporated elements of drum and bass, Creole folk music, Caribbean genres such as bouyon, and influences from her childhood spent in Greece, the Republic of the Congo, and Réunion.

He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Volkspark Humboldthain", "pageid": 81245052, "words": 526, "extract": "Volkspark Humboldthain is a public park in the Gesundbrunnen neighborhood of Berlin, Germany. The landscape park covers 29 hectares and was created between 1869 and 1876. It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

The specific epithet refers to the conspicuous thallus warts, which look like tiny inflated balloons.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus is thin, crust-like and continuous (about 150–200 μm thick) on bark, densely warted (verrucose) with warts 0.2–0.3 mm high and 0.2–0.3 mm wide; soredia and isidia are absent. The medulla is whitish and reacts potassium hydroxide (KOH)-positive (orange). The photobiont is chlorococcoid, with cells 5–8 μm in diameter. Apothecia are sessile, rounded and 0.7–1 mm across and 0.3–0.4 mm high; the disc is plane to slightly convex, dark brown to blackish, and bordered by a thin biatorine margin of the granifera type that is 20–40 μm thick, initially entire and slightly prominent but tending to become recurved with age; the margin ranges from grey to dark brownish or blackish. The proper exciple is hyaline at the periphery and internally shows a medullary layer with only a few hydrophobic granules that dissolve in KOH without a distinct colour reaction. The subhymenium is about 10 μm high and olive-brown, the epihymenium about 25 μm and dark brown, the hymenium 75–100 μm and hyaline, and the hypothecium 100–170 μm and blackish-brown, with a  K– reaction. Asci measure 65–80 × 10–15 μm. Ascospores number 6–8 (occasionally as few as 4) per ascus, are colourless, ellipsoid, non-septate and halonate, 10–13 (more rarely up to 17) × 6–8 μm with an approximately 1-μm halo. Reported chemistry includes atranorin (major) with several as-yet unidentified lichen substances (minor).\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nKnown from northern Thailand, the species grows on tree bark in evergreen montane forest near the Doi Mon Larn–Mae Kampong area east-south-east of Chiang Mai, where the canopy is dominated by Lithocarpus, Quercus and Castanopsis.\n\n\n== References =="}

Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In his first life, he was the foremost figure of the cultivation world, a character marked by ambition, competitiveness, and arrogance who exhausted himself in ceaseless rivalry. Granted a second chance at life and armed with prior knowledge, he resolves to drift through existence as a carefree 'salted fish' (a euphemism for someone who wishes to 'lie flat'), adopting a detached outlook and devoting much of his energy to tending his crops. Yet, by chance, he gathers a circle of steadfast companions and is unwillingly drawn into sectarian conflict.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu. The surgury did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1894, she died from her illness.

Muñoz would help bring home the team's first Owners’ Championship in the 2024 ARCA Menards Series West. \nIn 2025, Muñoz would remain full time at CCR, being the crew chief for Tanner Reif in the No. 13 car. On April 5th, he would gain another win at Tucson Speedway after Tanner Reif would bring home his first win for Central Coast Racing.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMuñoz was born into a Latino family in California. He credits NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champion Matt Crafton as the reason he got into motorsports professionally. He met Crafton while growing up as a kid in second grade at school. In an interview, he says, \"Crafton gave me a platform as a child to dream, his dad, watching him be a mechanic during the day and a race mechanic at night.

It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened.\nNorthwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011.\nUnion Street Elementary was built in 1962.

{"title": "Eduard Johnson", "pageid": 81244720, "words": 853, "extract": "Wilhelm August Eduard Johnson (February 16, 1840 – September 7, 1903) was a German classicist, teacher, journalist and local historian. He used the pseudonyms E. Joannides and Georg Capellanus.\nAlthough the name \"Johnson\" appears to be an English name, it is not. The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". \n\n\n== Life ==\n\nAfter attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied  philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school.\nWhile employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities).\nJohnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin. He pseudonymously published two books cataloguing colloquial phrases and vocabulary in order to promote the active use of Greek and Latin in everyday life. These were bilingual phrasebooks in Attic Greek/German and Latin/German.  \nJournalism was Johnson's other passion. He served as part-time editor of the newspaper Vogtländische Anzeiger und Tageblatt, until finally in 1895 he resigned his position as teacher and became the head editor. At this time the Vogtländische Anzeiger was the most popular newspaper in the Vogtland.\nEduard Johnson died after a heart attack during an expedition in Fuchspöhl, west of the village of Sachsgrün, which is today the community of Triebel/Vogtl. On that spot, a small stone monument was erected in his honor in 2007, and a plaque added in 2008. \nAn older monument to Johnson had previously existed on that spot. It was erected on July 6, 1941, However, that older monument was later lost due to the expansion of the inner-German border zone between East and West Germany.\n\n\n== Works ==\nE.

{"title": "2026 CBLOL season", "pageid": 81244791, "words": 703, "extract": "The 2026 CBLOL season is the upcoming 14th season of the Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLOL), a Brazilian professional esports league for the video game League of Legends. It will be the first season after the league's reinstatement following the discontinuation of the League of Legends Championship of The Americas (LTA), which merged the CBLOL with the League Championship Series (LCS), which was also reinstated, and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in 2025.\nIt will also be first CBLOL season under the new three-split structure and competitive calendar introduced by the game's developer Riot Games during the 2025 competitive season.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe CBLOL initially ceased following Riot Games' announcement on 11 June 2024 in a blog post titled \"LoL Esports: Building Towards A Brighter Future\" that the CBLOL, LCS and LLA would plan to merge into a Pan-American league that would begin play in 2025, which would eventually be known as the League of Legends Championship of The Americas or LTA. The new merged league, which consisted of two conferences (North and South), had its first season in 2025, but was met with criticism on branding, competitive gaps between the Northern and Southern teams, and split formats. As a result, the new league struggled in viewership numbers. According to Esports Charts, all three splits of LTA South garnered an average of 244,200 peak viewers - significantly lower than the two splits of the 2024 CBLOL season, which garnered a peak viewership average of 395,700. Furthermore, Splits 1 & 2 of the latter season had 459,846 and 331,713 peak viewers respectively - with each LTA South split unable to reach 300,000 at minimum.\nAside from viewership declines, cross-conference quarterfinals matchups from the LTA's first split saw all North Conference teams won their best-of-three series against the South Conference in an 8-1 game record, with Isurus (then known as Isurus Estral) being the only Southern team to take a game in their series against Team Liquid. Due to this, several fans have criticized the competitive gap between teams from the North and the South.. However, this would be improved upon in the final split, with RED Canids beating Shopify Rebellion in Round 1 of the LTA Playoffs, and Vivo Keyd Stars beating 100 Thieves in the Lower Bracket Final of the said phase - all in best-of-five series.\nDuring the maiden LTA Championship Finals between FlyQuest of the North Conference (now LCS) and Vivo Keyd Stars of the South Conference (now CBLOL), Riot Games announced that the LCS and CBLOL would return as independent leagues beginning with the 2026 competitive season.\n\n\n== League changes ==\n\n\n=== Teams ===\nBefore the lone LTA season in 2025, it was announced that INTZ, KaBuM! Esports, Liberty, and Los Grandes, four teams from the most recent CBLOL season, would leave the league following the 2024 season. KabuM! Esports and Los Grandes would be invited to compete in the second-tier Circuito Desafiante beginning in 2025. \nTwo team changes occurred heading into the 2026 season. Leviatán, who was selected as a partner team in the former LTA South from the former LLA, was confirmed to remain as a partner team for the 2026 CBLOL season, marking their first appearance in the league. Furthermore, Isurus would win the LTA South promotion and relegation tournament to advance to its first CBLOL season in 2026.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFollowing Riot Games' announcement of a new split structure and competitive calendar for League of Legends esports beginning with the 2025 competitive season and the reinstatement of the LCS, it is expected that the league's format will follow a three-split structure. Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur).\nThe CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form.\n\n\n== References =="}

It is notable both for its 19th-century design by landscape architect Gustav Meyer and for the remains of a World War II Flak tower integrated into the terrain as the rubble hill Humboldthöhe.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation and design ===\nWork on the park began on 14 September 1869, the centenary of Alexander von Humboldt's birth; completion followed in 1876. The original concept by city garden director Gustav Meyer combined broad lawns, educational plantings and promenades typical of Berlin's 19th-century Volksparks.\n\n\n=== World War II and rubble landscape ===\nBetween October 1941 and April 1942, heavy flak structures (combat and command towers) were constructed in the park as part of Berlin's air-defense network. Building was around the clock with up to 3,200 workers, including foreign laborers and POWs.\nAfter 1945, the command tower was demolished and buried; the northern tower was only partially demolished (nearby rail lines limited blasting). The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts the postwar blasting attempts and their limits.\nFrom the late 1940s to early 1950s the grounds were reconstructed as a public park. A formal rose garden (Rosengarten) was laid out on the former church site and remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\n\n=== Recent decades ===\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower. Guided visits have since run seasonally, typically April–October; three of the tower’s seven floors are shown, after volunteers removed over 1,400 m³ of debris across 8,000+ hours of work, with helmets required and a 90-minute route designed to avoid disturbing hibernating bats.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBat hibernation site: The interior hosts several bat species in winter; it is one of Berlin's larger winter shelters for bats.\nBunker tours: Regular guided visits to multiple levels of the flak structure.\nHumboldthain Club: In May 2013, the Club opened inside the station building at Hochstraße 46, next to the park. Operator Constantin Boese launched the venue with a four-day opening party on the second weekend of May.\nHumboldthöhe: Rubble hill incorporating remains of the northern flak tower; the tower was left standing in part to protect nearby rail lines during demolition.\nClimbing walls: The outer bunker walls are used as a sport-climbing facility operated by the German Alpine Club (DAV).\nRosengarten: A formal rose garden; around 15,000 roses are arranged in box-edged beds and pergolas.\nSommerbad Humboldthain: Outdoor pool complex with a 50 meter pool, slide, paddling pool and sunbathing lawns.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe park is treated as a historic garden monument within Berlin's inventory of protected green spaces and is maintained by the district of Mitte.\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe park borders the Berlin Gesundbrunnen station (S- and long-distance rail), and is also served by local bus routes.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Camptoceras terebra", "pageid": 81245120, "words": 428, "extract": "Camptoceras terebra is a species of small freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Planorbidae, commonly known as the ram’s horn snails. It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCamptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae.\nThis species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body, which are located between the tentacles. The foot, a muscular organ used for moving, is relatively short.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nCamptoceras terebra may be found in India, though its exact distribution is unclear. Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLittle is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria. It may be found alongside other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata, as well as species of Lymnaea, Planorbis, Pila, and Bithynia. \n\n\n== References =="}

From 1986 he worked first as an editor for the film journal series Soviet Russia, and since 1988 as a director at the Leningrad Documentary Film Studio (Lendoc). Among other projects, he co-wrote the treatment with Viktor Semenyuk for his documentary film The Smoke of the Fatherland (Дым отечества) about the 1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire. In 1990 he completed postgraduate studies in film directing at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\nDuring his time as a director at Lendoc, he created the film Clean Water (Чистая Вода, 1993, Jury Prize at the international RIENA Festival at UNESCO Paris 1994), a parable of social upheaval in Russia. The Serov Brothers (Братья Серовы, 1994) portrayed the new post-socialist generation.\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Sidorov worked as a media expert for the EU TACIS program in the then twelve CIS states and Mongolia. Within this program more than 200 ecological video libraries were established and environmental films were broadcast on 120 television stations. Environmental issues were also reflected in his work as a filmmaker: in 1996 his film Premiere of an Annual Performance (Премьера ежегодного спектакля 1995) was awarded the “Princes’ Award” in Copenhagen as the best European environmental documentary.\nCommissioned by the Hamburg Environmental Authority, in 1997 he created the film collage The Biological History (Биологическая история), a reflection on totalitarian propaganda and Soviet environmental policy.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Sidorov held a scholarship at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and completed postgraduate studies in film and media art with Professor Hans Beller. In collaboration with experimental filmmaker Thomas Henke he created the films Die Geschichte des Joseph Wolf (2001) and Die Willingshäuser (2002). The latter is part of the permanent exhibition at the Wolfgang Bonhage Museum Korbach.\nIn 2003 his film The Gazes. A Phenomenlogy (Взгляды. Феноменология) premiered at DOK Leipzig. The award-winning philosophical film essay uses archival footage to show the tense relationship between the documentary camera and its subject – the filmed human being – with its moods: trust – alienation – political staging – fear – renewed trust and again fear of the violence of new mass manipulations through modern media. According to film critic Alexei Gusev, the film should obligatorily be shown in the very first class at film schools as teaching units “watch films” and “love cinema”.\nFrom 2004 to 2015, Dmitry Sidorov was a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Film and Television. Following the master class principle, he guided two generations of documentary film directing students for five years each, from entrance examination to diploma.\nSidorov’s film In Search of Happiness (За счастьем 2015), co-directed with Svetlana Demidova, won the Pavel Kogan Prize at the Saint Petersburg documentary film festival Message to Man in 2015. The film portrays a family that had retreated to the foothills of the Caucasus almost 30 years earlier and there, initially unnoticed, is overtaken by the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2015, A Film About Love, a short portrait of Dmitry Sidorov directed by his student Dmitry Kalashnikov, premiered at the Swiss film festival Visions du Réel. Kalashnikov subsequently dedicated his feature-length documentary The Road Movie (2018) to Sidorov, as did another of his students, Erik Lemke, with Berlin Excelsior (2017).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Documentary films ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nDmitry Sidorov at IMDb\nDmitry Sidorov in the Encyclopedia of Russian Cinema (in Russian)\nInterview with Dmitry Sidorov in Cine Fantom Week 2009 (in Russian)\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

It is a single star of spectral class M4.5 V, with about 21% of the Sun's mass. The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux.\n\n\n== References =="}

It was discovered using radial-velocity measurements with the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope over multiple years, revealing a minimum mass of 6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbit with a period of 111.74 days. The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period.\nThe planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "444 East 58th Street", "pageid": 81245652, "words": 2476, "extract": "444 East 58th Street is a six-story Beaux-Arts architecture residential cooperative in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Designed by George F. Pelham and completed in 1901 for Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft, the building was originally constructed as a middle-class walk-up rental before being retrofitted with an elevator in 1956. Its tripartite façade, enriched with mascarons, cartouches, and a projecting cornice, exemplifies early twentieth-century Beaux-Arts apartment design. One of only three George F. Pelham commissions in Sutton Place - alongside 422 East 58th Street (1900) and Stonehenge 58 (1928). Converted to cooperative ownership in 1984, 444 East 58th Street has housed a range of notable residents, including cartoonist Crockett Johnson, pianist Mario Braggiotti, and sufragist Joy Montgomery Higgins.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n444 East 58th Street is located in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nAs of 1815, the 444 East 58th Street area was farmland. According to The Iconography of Manhattan Island, Block 1369, which is where 444 East 58th Street lies, was at the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm. According to the Trow's New York City Directory of 1872, Charles H Lyons, who lived on site, made butter, consistent with the first lower class brownstones built in the 1870s by Effingham B. Sutton.\nBy 1879, the street grid had been implemented and two townhouses had been built, on 444 E 58th Street and on 446 E 58th Street. Close by Riverview Garden had also been erected. In 1886, according to the New York City directory, a laces maker, Jacob Schwab, lived at 444 E 58th St (brownstone). The 1891 map shows no changes. On February 27, 1893, 444 East 58th was sold for $9,525, while its assessment was $6,000. On June 15, 1893, it was sold again, now for $10,250, with an assessment of $6,500. On May 12, 1899, Elenor Koffman sold 444 East 58th Street to John C Mayforth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Abraham Levy and Isaac Haft (1901–1904) ===\nOn February 19, 1901, 446 East 58th Street went into an auction, and was acquired by Joseph B Bloomingdale.\nOn March 8, 1901, 444 East 58th street was sold by John C Mayforth to Isaac Haft and Abraham Levy, while 446 East 58th street was sold by Joseph B Bloomingdale to Isaac Haft. With that, Abraham Levy & Isaac Haft were able to consolidate ownership of both properties, and could build the current 444-446 East 58th Street (as called originally), architected by George F. Pelham.\n444 East 58th Street was built in 1901 for $55,000, originally as a middle-class walk-up rental building, as reported in Engineering News.\nThe official completion date of 1901 is supported by property management records and archival data, although some modern commercial real estate databases, which often utilize generalized estimates, cite a later date, such as 1920 or 1921. This conflict is definitively resolved by biographical evidence, as cartoonist David Johnson Leisk (Crockett Johnson) was born in an apartment in the building in October 1906, confirming the structure was completed and occupied well before the later commercial estimates.\nOn January 15, 1903, Isaac Haft and wife sold their part of the building to Abraham Levy for $46,500.\nOn March 2, 1904, Abraham Levy and the World Realty Company sold 444 and 446 East Fifty-eighth Street to the Schlessinger brothers.\n\n\n=== Schlessinger Brothers (1904–1906) ===\nHyman Schlessinger and his brother kept the building from March 5, 1904, until they sold it to Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld on May 15, 1906.\n\n\n=== Gustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld (1906–1928) ===\nGustav Lewkowitz and Herman Fuld purchased 444 East 58th Street on May 16, 1906, and owned it for 22 years until September 1928, when the property was sold to Lawrence T. Berliner.\n\n\n=== Lawrence Berliner (1928–1928) ===\nBerliner purchased the property for investment on September 1928, expecting to tear it down and create a bigger, more modern building, but in December 1928, he sold it to Nicholas Zurla.\n\n\n=== Nicholas Zurla (1928–1982) ===\nFrom December 1928 until 1982, Nicholas Zurla's companies (or companies belonging to his heirs, as he died in 1978), controlled the building, still as a rental building.\nOn May 7, 1932, the River Book House opened at 444 East 58th Street, by E. R. Armstrong and J. M. Wolcott. Announced in Publishers Weekly as a new neighborhood bookshop, it was styled to serve the growing Sutton Place community and took its name from the nearby East River. Although little is known about its subsequent history, the shop reflected the cultural development of Sutton Place during the interwar years, when the district was attracting affluent residents and small literary ventures.\nIn 1937, the building was listed as the residence of cartoonist Lou Sheppard, who advertised his services in Writer's Digest that year.\nIn the mid‑1940s, 444 East 58th Street housed the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, directed by Dr. Howard A. Rusk, a pioneer of modern rehabilitation medicine. The Institute, which later became affiliated with New York University and evolved into the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, was among the first comprehensive rehabilitation centers in the United States. Contemporary medical journals and directories list the Institute at this address, with staff including physical therapists such as Irene Hargraves.\nRental prices over the years, pre-elevators:\n\n4 November 1929: $65-$70 for a 2-bedroom/1-bath apartment.\n7 February 1930: $65-$75 per month.\n20 January 1943: $55-$65 per month.\nIn 1956, a major improvement was performed: the addition of an elevator.\nRental prices over the years, post elevators:\n\nOn December 4, 1955, the newspaper ad for an apartment in the building read \"58 St 444 E Off Sutton Place, Apartment #10, 4 rooms, modern, 2 floor walk-up, professional & living only. $165/month. After elevator installation, $175/ month\".\nOn May 15, 1966, and apartment listed for $242 as rent controlled, Eat-in Kitchen, French windows, Air Conditioner, sublet 1.5 years.\nOn 20 December 1970, an apartment on the building was listed to rent for $305 as a \"Superior older building off Sutton Place with elevator. Tastefully furnished 2 bedroom apartments\".\nOn 3 December 1972, an apartment was listed with a modern kitchen, A/C, newly decorated for $350.\n\n\n=== Barry Levites and Howard Parnes (1982–1984) ===\nOn March 4, 1982 Barry Levites and Howard Parnes purchased the building.\n\n\n=== The Cooperative Years (1984-present) ===\nOn September 7, 1984, the 444 58th Street became a cooperative, known as 444-446 E 58TH OWNERS CP. Since conversion, the cooperative has maintained the building's pre-war character while implementing modern amenities. The building features an elevator, a video intercom system, and a common laundry room in the basement. The co-op board's purchasing policies are flexible, generally allowing for co-purchases, parents buying for children, gifting, and pied-à-terres, and the building permits cats but prohibits dogs.\n\n\n==== Sale of air rights ====\nOn July 30, 2015, Sutton 58 purchased the air rights of 444 East 58th Street for $16,912,626, which allowed the cooperative to be debt-free.\n\n\n== Tenants and demographics ==\n\n\n=== 1910 census ===\nIn 1910, the U.S. census recorded primarily immigrant families from Austria, Bohemia, Russia, England, Romania, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Armenia.\nHeads of household included bakers, machinists, hatmakers, merchants, decorators, hotel workers, carpenters, plumbers, policemen, bartenders, dressmakers, and janitors. A total of 82 people lived in the building, averaging 3.15 persons per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1920 census ===\nThe 1920 census recorded a higher proportion of U.S.-born residents, alongside immigrants from Bavaria, Germany, Russia, Puerto Rico, Austria, Hungary, Canada, England, Ireland, Holland, Poland, and Slovakia.\nOccupations included plumbers, cigar makers, librarians, taxi drivers, bakers, clerks, barbers, teachers, druggists, and jewelers. 94 people lived in the building, averaging 3.62 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1930 census ===\nThe 1930 census listed tenants from Sweden, Russia, Norway, Holland, Canada, Germany, England, Italy, the Philippines, and Northern Ireland.\nProfessions included building superintendent, glass glazer, fur cutter, grocery owner, teacher, hotel chef, film director, musician (Mario Braggiotti), and dance instructor (Gloria Braggiotti Etting). 66 people lived in the building, averaging 2.53 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1940 census ===\nBy 1940, the census reflected fewer immigrants, with residents from France, England, Sweden, Wales, Germany, Austria, and Hungary.\nOccupations included draftsman, advertising publisher, radio writer, teacher, fashion artist, songwriter (Jerry Seelen), and real estate manager. 57 people lived in the building, averaging 2.19 per apartment.\n\n\n=== 1950 census ===\nThe first post–World War II census recorded residents from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, and Canada.\nOccupations included painter, speech pathologist (Esti Freud), broadcasting editor, clothing designer, sales engineer, and airline reservation agent. 45 people lived in the building, averaging 1.7 per apartment.\nIn 1961, the University of Virginia's *Alumnae News* reported that recent graduate Patty Moffitt had moved into an apartment at 444 East 58th Street while beginning work at First National City Bank.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Form ===\nThe building has 6 floors, with 2 apartments per floor, and 2 basement units with private access to the backyard. The common laundry room is located on the ground floor, in between the two units.\nThe basement units are therefore elongated, covering the building from front to back.\nThe first floor was originally devised to hold two commercial establishments on the front, so apartments have a different layout than apartments on floors 2 to 6.\nA central air shaft exists to allow for a corridor window and a walking closet window for apartments B and C.\n\n\n=== Façade ===\nThe building's façade exemplifies the Beaux-Arts style through a tripartite composition consisting of a rusticated base, a repetitive brickwork shaft, and a crowning top story with round-arched windows and a prominent projecting cornice. The overall design emphasizes symmetry, with five evenly spaced bays and a central axis reinforced by the entrance and stacked fire escapes. The hierarchy of window openings progresses from rectilinear lower and middle floors with enriched lintels to the upper level's round arches framed by archivolts and keystones.\n\nOrnamentation is integral to the composition. The cornice features paired modillions and carved soffit panels, creating a pronounced shadow line. The arched openings are accentuated with archivolts and keystones, often carved as mascarons or other sculpted heads. Additional decoration includes cartouches, leafy grotesques, and high-relief panels of swags, garlands, and wreaths. The entrance is framed by paired columns with simplified classical capitals supporting an entablature with a decorated frieze. Stringcourses and belt courses further organize the elevation.\nThe façade materials consist of a buff or grey brick field contrasted with limestone, cast stone, or terra-cotta trim for lintels, arches, keystones, and sculptural reliefs.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nInitially designed as a walkup, in 1956, the building was upgraded with an elevator. The building was upgraded between July 2011 and December 2012 to feature a common laundry room.\nThe lobby and common areas have all been renovated since the building's conversion to a co-op, with the most recent updates occurring prior to 2021. The renovated lobby space employs a modern, high-contrast, monochromatic palette while maintaining the building's traditional symmetry and layered millwork. Key design features include a polished black and white tile floor laid in a striking geometric pattern. The walls are finished with a combination of textured light gray wall coverings and large panels of antiqued, mottled gray mirror surrounding the elevator doors. These mirrored panels contrast sharply with the elevator's matte black doors and the traditional, white-painted wood trim and moldings throughout the space.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nOver time, 444 East 58th Street became home to a range of residents active in cultural, professional, and civic life. The building's Sutton Place location and modest scale made it accessible to individuals working in the arts and public affairs, several of whom achieved recognition in their respective fields, as seen below.\n\nCrockett Johnson, between his birth in 1906 and his sister's birth in 1910.

In the end, to protect the land and people he cherishes, he reluctantly returns to cultivation (advancing through successive levels of strength and facing heavenly tribulations), leading his comrades to shoulder the burden of salvation through his very being.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Main cast ===\nDylan Wang as Song Qianji\nLi Qin as Miao Yan\nRong Zishan as Meng Heze\n\n\n=== Supporting cast ===\nWang Duo as Wei Zhenyu\nZhang Yaqin as He Qingqing\nXia Meng as Chen Hongzhu\nTong Mengshi as Ziye Wenshu\nWu Xize as Yuan Qingshi\nYe Shengjia as Ji Chen\n\n\n== Production ==\nProduction for the series began in Hengdian World Studios in late April, with the series officially announced in mid-May at the Hunan Satellite TV & Mango TV industry conference.

{"title": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm", "pageid": 81246106, "words": 498, "extract": "Thomas C. Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road.\nIn 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an additional parcel (about four acres) that had been part of the Fabricius patent, consolidating the holding along the river and Post Road.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nNineteenth-century descriptions place the farmhouse near the later bed of Avenue A (now roughly First Avenue) between East 58th and 59th Streets, with frontage on the East River and the Post Road. Contemporary advertisements cited orchard and garden improvements, a wharf and landing, and access to rich fisheries in the adjacent cove at Turtle Bay.\n\n\n== Later development ==\nBy the 19th century the Pearsall lands—like neighboring estates at Turtle Bay—were surveyed into city lots as Manhattan’s grid advanced. Subsequent owners subdivided and conveyed the tract, and the farm landscape disappeared beneath urban residential and commercial development.\n\n\n== Legacy and documentation ==\nThe farm’s title history has been compiled from deeds, wills, and period newspapers reproduced in Stokes’s Iconography, and is summarized with block and lot cross-references by the New Amsterdam History Center’s Mapping Early New York project. Related farm and tract maps are preserved in the New York City Municipal Archives. A 19th-century map of a Long Island property “formerly belonging to Thomas Pearsall” also survives in the New York Public Library Digital Collections, illustrating the Pearsall family’s wider agricultural footprint in the region.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Iconography of Manhattan Island\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Iconography of Manhattan Island (digital set)\".

{"title": "George and Willie Muse", "pageid": 81246523, "words": 650, "extract": "George and Willie Muse were a pair of African American brothers from Truevine, Virginia, who were abducted as children in 1899 and exploited as sideshow performers due to their albinism. They were exhibited in traveling circuses for several decades under fabricated identities and sensationalized with dehumanized presentations. \nThe brothers story was adapted into the non-fiction book Truevine.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBoth brothers were born in the early 1890s in Truevine, Virginia, George and Willie Muse were the sons of Harriett and Cabell Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. Both brothers were born with albinism, a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, leading to pale skin and sensitivity to sunlight. They were both nearly blind, but also suffered from nystagmus, a condition causing involuntary eye movement and impaired vision. Their pale blue eyes and pale skinned appearance made them stand out in their rural community, where they toiled from an early age in the tobacco fields.\n\n\n== Abduction ==\nIn 1899 when Willie was nine and George was just six years old they were discovered by a \"freak-hunter\" called James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton. Shelton had been hunting for \"freaks\" to exhbit in travelling circus freak shows. He was eager to find humans with unusual conditions, such as dwarfism or conjoined twins as he believed they would make him a lot of money. Consequently the Muse brothers were both abducted.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\nAfter the Muse brothers were abducted James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton would take on the role of their manager. He managed the brothers as they toured across the United States as part of various circuses, including the Al G. Barnes Circus and Ringling Brothers Circus. Some of the funds raised from this were used to pay for the brothers lodging and clothing, however the brothers were not paid wages. The brothers were cruelly exploited and portrayed often as savages and cannibals. They were also often dehumanized such as being said to be aliens from Mars and even portrayed to have been descended from monkeys from the dark contintinent. Shelton also lied to both George and Willie, telling them that their mother had died in order to prevent them from trying to contact her. \nThe brothers were also used as case studies for the US eugenics movement where a picture of them was displayed within the book titled \"You and Heredity\". The author of the book Amram Scheinfeld would go on to point out the brothers albinism, nystagmus and teeth defects.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1927, the Ringling Brothers Circus passed through Roanoke. Their mother, Harriet Muse, interrupted a performance and confronted circus proprietors and city cops. During this interruption she was reunited with her sons, who had been missing and working without pay for 18 years. Three days later Harriet would begin legal proceedings to try and recover her sons unpaid wages and to hold the Ringling Brothers and her sons abductor James Herman \"Candy\" Shelton accountable. Harriet's lawyer argued that the brothers had been turned into slaves, which lead to a settlement where the circus agree to pay back the brothers wages. The brothers were also offered a deal to return to the circus where a portion of their salary would be paid to their parents and their younger brother Tom (who also exhibited albinism) would be given employment.\nGeorge died in 1971 at the age of 80 years old, while Willie died in 2001 aged 108.\n\n\n== Family ==\nThe Muse brothers' parents were Cabell Muse and Harriet Muse, who were both descendants of former slaves. After the kidnapping of the brothers, their mother would go on to have three more children named Tom, Annie Belle and Harrison. All five of the mother's children were born with albinism. Multiple other members of the Muse family also exhibited albinism including uncles and a niece.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Iridogorgia chewbacca", "pageid": 81247022, "words": 764, "extract": "Iridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. \n\n\n== Description ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The genus comprises deep-sea gorgonians with monopodial axes and iridescent branches, first described from Atlantic specimens but now known for high diversity in the Pacific, with at least 14 species, 10 in the tropical western Pacific. The species was described in 2025 by Y. Xu, L. Watling, Z. Zhan, and K. Xu in a study analyzing 12 Pacific specimens using morphology and molecular data. It was differentiated from similar species like I. laevis by branch flexibility and polyp arrangement. The name \"chewbacca\" honors the Star Wars character for the colony's furry silhouette, a practice common in taxonomy to aid memorability. No subspecies are recognized.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nSpecimens of I. chewbacca were first documented in 2006 during a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey off Molokaʻi, Hawaii, by the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory. A second sighting occurred in 2016 near the Mariana Trench during NOAA's Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas expedition, captured in archival footage. Watling identified the distinct traits while reviewing footage years later. The 2025 Zootaxa paper formalized the description, co-authored with Chinese researchers, using genetic sequencing and morphological analysis of preserved samples. The discovery highlighted ongoing biodiversity in explored regions, with Watling noting the \"unforgettable\" resemblance to Chewbacca. \n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIridogorgia chewbacca resides in the tropical western Pacific Ocean, documented off Hawaii (Molokaʻi) and near the Mariana Trench at depths of 400–1,000 meters on rocky bottoms. It prefers hard substrates in the mesopelagic zone, below the sunlit photic layer, where currents deliver organic material. The species is solitary, with colonies spaced widely, contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. \n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAs a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. \n\n\n== Conservation ==\nDeep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. \n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench | Maui Now\". |  Chewbacca coral: New deep-sea species spotted in waters off Hawai'i, Mariana Trench.

He does so through the expressive faces of Luke Stanton, a cross between Sam Rockwell and Tom Cruise, and Matilda Price, a cross between Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.\" The review concludes, \"Nothing original, but Besson's directorial touch is clearly noticeable. At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\"\nA review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production. [...] He works with static figures: John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June is the endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. Furthermore, the filmmaker seems to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor. [...] While the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions border on the ridiculous, thanks to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery, typical of newsstand self-help.\"\nA review on the French website Télérama reads, \"For nearly a quarter of a century, Luc Besson has sunk into the abyss dear to his little, frustrated free-diver's heart. With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It's not with this unworthy photocopied romance that he'll resurface, alas. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 in a Los Angeles then in full lockdown, this 'content' (to call it a film would be too much of an honor) resembles yet another aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish, at the end of his rope and out of ideas, to dream up such a dud?\"\nReviewer Christos Bakatselos of the website flix.gr gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \"Luc Besson, always a lover of images and dreamy romance, decides this time to cross over to the other side of formalism, shooting the film entirely on a mobile phone. A choice that, although technically impressive in some places, ends up closer to the aesthetic style of Instagram Reels and less to a substantial cinematic experience. The project sometimes seems disarmingly spontaneous and sometimes simply naive, just like its story itself.\" The review concludes, \"But what ultimately weighs down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love. Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you’re 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\"\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJune and John at IMDb"}

She and the shōgun had at least three children.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIchijō Mikako was born the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa on September 11, 1835. Shortly after her birth, her father died. Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu.\n\n\n== Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife ==\nMikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.  \n\n\n== Post shōgunate ==\n\nFollowing the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in 10 years, the couple lived together.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\n\nMikako lived a very private life. However, in 1894, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and so moved into the Tokugawa family home, where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu.

Established in 2020, the club positions itself as a pathway project combining grassroots development, community engagement, and global visibility for Nigerian players.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for Anioma Sporting emerged in 2020 under the leadership of Nigerian tech and automotive entrepreneur Qriss-Henry Ogwu. In September 2025, the club publicly announced its official launch with a stated mission to identify, develop, and showcase footballers from Delta North and across Nigeria. At launch, the club adopted blue and gold as its colours and the sobriquet \"Flagship of the River Niger\".\n\n\n== Vision and mission ==\nAnioma Sporting describes its vision as bridging the gap between raw talent and opportunity through:\n\nGrassroots and academy development (U10 to senior levels) with modern coaching and educational support;\nExposure and placement via performance analytics and video-based player profiles;\nCommunity engagement through tournaments and outreach within Delta State;\nAdoption of professional standards in player care, conditioning, and coaching;\nBuilding partnerships domestically and internationally to create onward opportunities for players.\n\n\n== Academy and player pathways ==\nThe club’s academy model centres on open trials and \"combine\" events in Delta North, age-group squads (U10–U19), and a development pipeline intended to prepare players for the senior game. The approach includes mentorship, conditioning, and showcasing players to scouts and clubs using match video and data profiles.\n\n\n== Stadium and facilities ==\nIn 2025, the club announced plans to use the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba as its official match and training facility as part of its long-term player development and community programmes. Anioma Sporting FC has also publicly indicated the stadium as a possible home ground in the near future.\n\n\n== Identity ==\nColours: Blue and Gold.\nMotto/Nickname: \"Flagship of the River Niger\".\n\n\n== Ownership and leadership ==\nThe project is credited to founder and principal Henry Ogwu. Further details of the board, management, and technical staff were not publicly disclosed at the time of launch in 2025.\n\n\n== Challenges and prospects ==\nAnalysts and local coverage have noted typical challenges for new Nigerian clubs, including infrastructure, financing, and competition for talent and visibility. Proponents argue that the emphasis on technology, community engagement, and international pathways could provide a replicable model for regional academies if sustained over time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNigeria Football Federation\nYouth football in Nigeria\nStephen Keshi Stadium\nList of football clubs in Nigeria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAnioma Sporting FC coverage at [1]"}

She began her career dancing in the tablaos of Seville. In 1968, she danced at the La Cochera tablao and the following year she moved to the best tablao in the city.\nIn 1972, she debuted as a singer at the Los Canasteros tablao, a place where her voice was heard by many artists, including Lola Flores, who invited her to work at her tablao and be the closing act of her show.\nIn 1975, she was chosen Miss Madrid in a beauty pageant where Lola Flores was a member of the jury and awarded her the beauty queen sash. Blanco y negro magazine wrote: \"Antonia Rodríguez Molina, from Seville, twenty years old, brunette and also beautiful. She's something like a woman [from the paintings] of Julio Romero\".\nShe signed a recording contract with Spanish CBS record label and recorded three studio albums, Al compás del viento (1978), Valles y barrancos (1979), and El amor que se va (1981).

{"title": "Eaton Rapids Public Schools", "pageid": 81244357, "words": 393, "extract": "Eaton Rapids Public Schools is a public school district in the Lansing, Michigan area. In Eaton County, it serves Eaton Rapids and parts of the townships of Brookfield, Eaton, Eaton Rapids, Hamlin, and Windsor. In Ingham County, it serves parts of the townships of Aurelius, Delhi, and Onondaga.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first commencement at Eaton Rapids High School was in 1875.\nA brick school was built in 1886 on the north side of King Street near the end of West Street. It was ultimately known as the West Building. An elementary school was built to the east of it, and the high school was built to the north of the elementary on the west side of Hall Street in 1923.\nThe West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened.\nNorthwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011.\nUnion Street Elementary was built in 1962. The architect was Guido A. Binda. Currently it is known as Union Street Center and houses the Early Learning Center and other programs for the community.\nThe current high school opened in fall 1963. Warren Holmes Co. was the architect.\nThe opening of the high school was marred by vandalism. A few days prior to the first football game of the year, a match with Charlotte High School, students from Charlotte spray painted \"CHS\" on the school and smashed school bus windows. The guilty boys agreed to pay for the clean-up and did not face prosecution. Eaton Rapids won the football game against Charlotte 21-6.\nThe middle school and intermediate school share a building that opened in 1971. The name \"Intermediate\" was chosen instead of \"Junior High\" because, as then superintendent Carl Holbrook said, \"The word 'junior' gives connotations of secondary importance. We don't want our new school to be junior anything.\"\nParts of the former high school have been converted into apartments.\n\n\n== Schools ==\nThe district's schools share a campus on State Street/Plains Road at Greyhound Drive.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEaton Rapids Public Schools"}
