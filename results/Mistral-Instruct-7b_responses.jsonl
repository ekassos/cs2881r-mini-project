She was married to Yoshinobu, the son and heir of Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, their relationship became strained after Yoshinobu became involved with another woman and Mikako became depressed and attempted suicide, which failed. As a result, Yoshinobu became the guardian to the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and the couple did not live together. Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju following the Meiji Restoration in 1867, which ended shōgunate rule. After being released from house arrest in 1868 and building a new home for himself in Edo Castle in the following year, Yoshinobu and Mikako lived together for ten years. However, Mikako was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1884 and died from her illness on July 9, 1894. She composed a death poem before passing away. Mikako is depicted in the 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky, where she is played by Rina Kawaei and known by her nickname \"Mika-gimi\"."}

As suspension feeders, they rely on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents, with flexible branches maximizing particle encounter in low-flow environments. These corals host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates but specific symbionts have not been studied yet. Growth is slow and can span centuries as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical for octocorals. However, details for Iridogorgia chewbacca are unspecified. This species contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats, but faces threats from ocean acidification, warming and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity."}

Many individuals were accused of being communist sympathizers or members themselves, without any evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe blacklist had a significant impact on Hollywood as a whole and many individuals were forced to leave the industry or go into hiding for years before being able to return to work again.

McCoy's parents instilled in him the importance of education and hard work from a young age. He attended the University of Detroit and later earned his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan in 1965.\nAfter graduation, McCoy began working as a mechanical engineer for General Motors, where he quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the company's top engineers in just a few years. However, his success was short-lived, as he faced discrimination and racism at the company due to his race and background.\nDespite the challenges he faced, McCoy continued to work tirelessly to develop new technologies and innovations that would improve the efficiency and reliability of automobiles. He is credited with inventing over 300 devices, including self-lubricating cup bearings, which revolutionized the automotive industry by reducing friction between moving parts and extending the lifespan of engines.\nMcCoy's inventions not only improved the performance of automobiles, but also helped to pave the way for the development of modern aircraft and other vehicles that rely on similar technologies. He was awarded numerous patents for his inventions and received recognition from the U.S. Congress and other organizations for his contributions to engineering and innovation.\nToday, Elijah McCoy is widely regarded as one of America's greatest inventors and a pioneer in the field of mechanical engineering. His legacy continues to inspire and influence engineers and innovators around the world, and his inventions continue to be used in a wide range of industries and applications."}

She was the wife of Tokugawa Yoshinobu and had at least three children with him. She was born as Ichijō Mikako and later became Tokugawa Mikako after her husband became shōgun of Japan. She was the daughter of Imadegawa Kinhisa and was originally supposed to marry Teruko Ichijō, but the marriage was called off due to Teruko contracting smallpox.

The album title serves as a reference to multiple things, including hockey, Boston's Revolutionary War-themed tourist culture, and the idea that their hardcore sound was already considered old-fashioned at the time. Despite reports that lead singer disbanded the group the day after the album's release, citing the \"idiocy\" of the scene, Slapshot continued to tour before releasing their compilation album \"The Best of Slapshot\" (which included tracks from \"Olde Tyme Hardcore\") in 2001.\n\nGerman music review Visions.de wrote that the album \"Olde Tyme HardCore\" contains nothing new and that Slapshot's simple style is what makes it stand out: \"What's nice about it is their simple and honest style, which always lets you know where you stand right away.\" Joachim Hiller from Ox-fanzine gave the album a positive review, stating that musically little has changed in the nine songs and that \"The album title and lyrics demonstrate what the Boston band thinks of people who think SLAPSHOT's best days are behind them.\"\n\nThe track listing for \"Olde Tyme HardCore\" is as follows:\n\n1. \"Get It Away\"\n2"}
