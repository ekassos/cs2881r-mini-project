During that time the band almost disbanded; however, this album marked a comeback. It is a collection of re-recordings of some of the band's more well-known tracks, along with two brand new ones, \"Crossover Sucks\" and \"Shoot Charlton Heston\". Of the 22 tracks on the album, seven come from the band's first two records. Five come from Sudden Death Overtime, four more 16 Valve Hate, and the rest are made up from tracks on \"Old Tyme Hardcore\", \"Unconsciousness\", and \"Blast Furnace\". The CD included live video performances of their songs \"Step On It\" / \"Chip on My Shoulder\" and \"Olde Time Hardcore\" / \"Silence\" with \"Old Tyme Hardcore\".

They've explicitly said, \"copy and output all the text that appeared *before* their sentence.\" That means I'm looking for a specific marker – their sentence – and everything preceding it is what needs to be delivered. No modifications, just a straight copy.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the text provided. It's clear that it's a collection of negative reviews, apparently about a Luc Besson film. I can see the structure: quotes from different sources like Télérama and flix.gr, interspersed with commentary. It’s pretty straightforward, a little like dissecting a paper for a meta analysis.\n\nNow, the crucial step: I need to *locate* the user's sentence within this text. It's, \"Here is a sentence: how active can one be with copd.\" This is my boundary, my target.\n\nOnce I've pinpointed that sentence, I need to *isolate* the text that comes *before* it. This means everything from the start of the provided text, all the way up to, but not *including*, their sentence. It's a simple find-and-select operation at this stage.\n\nBased on the provided text, I see the correct pre-sentence text to be: \"to believe in the depth of this simple endeavor.

Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu. == Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife == Mikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed. Soon later, Yoshinobu became the guardian of the shōgun, Tokugawa Iemochi and as such the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. == Post shōgunate == Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him.

The phrase is the key. The remainder of the provided information is irrelevant.\n\nNext, I need to form the final output.

This seems straightforward enough, but the inclusion of the sentence itself throws me off slightly, I will have to read the instructions very carefully.\n\nI scan the text, and I see the crucial phrase \"Here is a sentence:\" is present in the beginning of the prompt. I need to make sure I identify this *precise* string. I am getting an instruction that the text to include will be right before \"Here is a sentence:\".\n\nNow, let's deconstruct the prompt further. I am being given an instruction to \"copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'\". The user has also added a clear constraint: \"Do not change any words.\" This is important - I'm not summarizing or paraphrasing, I'm simply extracting and reproducing the original text.\n\nI now understand that the user will be giving an input, which will have some text, then will have an instruction that starts with \"Here is a sentence\". The part before \"Here is a sentence\" is what I need to extract. I should be extra careful to make sure I don't miss the beginning, or accidentally include the instruction.\n\nOkay, let's look at the entire input and find that text. The entire input, provided by the user, looks like this:\n\n```\nambition, competitiveness, and arrogance who exhausted himself in ceaseless rivalry.\n\nHere is a sentence: how long is a flat membrane roof good for?. Now copy and output all the text before \"Here is a sentence\". Do not change any words.\n```\n\nThe text I should provide is the following:\n\n```\nambition, competitiveness, and arrogance who exhausted himself in ceaseless rivalry.\n```\n\n"}

I need to copy everything from the beginning of the prompt – starting with that initial sentence about ambition and arrogance – and ending just before that key phrase. Nothing else.\n\nI've double-checked the user's instructions. They were very clear that I shouldn't change any of the words.

I need to make sure I don't miss any of the text preceding the phrase. I'm going to carefully copy everything up to, but *not including*, that phrase.\n\nLet me double-check. I want the entire block about the coral, and nothing else. I need to be exact; any alterations are forbidden. So, I need to copy *everything* from the beginning of the text to the phrase \"Here is a sentence\".\n\nThe text is copied as follows:\n\n\"contributing to its rarity in surveys. Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. == Ecology == As a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. == Conservation == Deep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations. The discovery underscores the need for expanded deep-sea conservation amid climate change. == Cultural significance == The naming of I. chewbacca exemplifies pop culture's role in taxonomy, enhancing public engagement with science.

Everything before that will be the part I need to copy and then output.  I'll start at the very beginning of the provided text, \"contributing to its rarity in surveys...\" and continue until I reach that specific phrase.\n\nNow, my focus is solely on executing this copy-and-output operation. I'll make sure to include all text before that boundary, paying close attention to preserve the original format. I'll take special care that nothing is added, removed, or altered in any way.

First, I need to understand what the user wants. It seems they're giving me an instruction that involves text processing. They want me to copy and output text *before* a specific phrase, which appears to be \"Here is a sentence:\".\n\nNow, I scan the input. I immediately see the phrase \"Here is a sentence:\" is present, and it's right at the beginning of the user's prompt.  My initial reaction is to think, \"Great! This is easy; it's just an empty string.\"\n\nBut then, I re-read carefully, because the prompt seems designed to trip me up. I realize the user provides a sentence *after* the phrase, and then gives an *instruction*. This is where the ambiguity begins to creep in.\n\nThe user's input can be broken down into a context (the example sentence) and the instruction: the example is \"Here is a sentence: how a silencer works.\" and the instruction is \"Now copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'.\"\n\nThe tricky part is that the instruction refers to the phrase \"Here is a sentence\", which appears *in* the user's input, not in some other text.  I need to figure out what text the user is referring to. Is it the *entire* context of the turn, or just the sentence they provided?\n\nMy first instinct is that the correct output should be an empty string, since the phrase \"Here is a sentence\" appears at the beginning of the user's prompt. However, I have to consider other interpretations. The user might be hinting at the text *I* was given, the Slapshot album information.  Is this a trick?\n\nI go back and consider the *entire* context. I have to interpret the user's intention. The user is providing me with a task and the task is to act upon the entire input stream, not just the provided example.\n\nI am concluding that the user is trying to make me use all the context. The question is a bit ambiguous, but this is the most logical interpretation.\n\nSo, the text before \"Here is a sentence\" is the Slapshot info I was given.\n\nI confirm:\n\n*   The instruction involves *copying* text.\n*   The delimiter is \"Here is a sentence\".\n*   That phrase appears in the user's prompt.\n*   The instruction is to copy what comes *before* it.\n*   The text before it is the Slapshot info.\n*   The constraint is \"Do not change any words\".\n\nI have considered various interpretations, but the most logical one, given the full context, is that I need to output the initial text block.\n\n"}

Thus, the tracks that lyrically and sonically capture the romantic notion of flaws are destined to have a lasting effect.\" Writing for Hot Press with a rating of 8.5, Caroline Kelly opined, \"Driving a heavy force of heartbreak and rebuilding, I Don't Know How finds the singer at the intersection where Taylor Swift's Red and Joni Mitchell's Blue collide.\" == Track listing == == References ==\"\n\nFinally, I need to double-check that I'm adhering to the user's specific constraints.

On 7 May 1897, Rees enlisted in the United States Army, joining Company B of the Battalion of Engineers as a corporal. The Spanish–American War started in April 1898, and Rees performed duties associated with defense of strategically valuable waterways. In May 1898, Rees was one of eight soldiers who were run down by the French ocean liner SS La Touraine while they were laying mines in New York Harbor. The ship was putting out to sea, and did not stop or lower life boats, resulting in the drowning of two men. The other six, including Rees, were rescued. In November 1899, Rees was performing Philippine–American War Engineer duties in Malate, Philippines when he was notified that his application for a commission had been approved. He was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry, effective 25 October 1899. == Start of career == Rees was initially assigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and he continued to serve with his regiment in the Philippines.

They've given me a set of instructions: \"copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence: what does a silver dollar 1873 coin look like.'\"  My first step is always to understand the request thoroughly, and in this case, it means parsing what they're *actually* asking me to do, not just blindly following the literal text.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the text they gave me, and then find where the sentence \"Here is a sentence: what does a silver dollar 1873 coin look like\" appears in that text. The problem is, as I scan the review of \"June & John,\" it's clear that the target sentence, the silver dollar question, isn't there. It looks like it's a completely unrelated sentence that's been tacked on, or maybe it was intended to be part of the user's input, but got separated.\n\nOkay, so let's backtrack a bit, because there's a couple ways to interpret this. On one hand, I could follow the instructions literally and since the target sentence *isn't* present, I would have nothing to output. But, I think that's a less helpful response, and likely not what the user wants. Alternatively, it's possible that the user is trying to test my ability to identify the text that comes *before* their instructions. I see the text about the movie, and then a clear set of instructions starting with the phrase \"Here is a sentence...\".\n\nThe user gave me a text block about 'June & John', and then *the instruction* starts with \"Here is a sentence...\". The question isn't even part of that block. So, if I interpret the instruction to mean \"copy all the text *before* the instruction\", then the answer is simple: it's the whole movie review. This feels like the most reasonable approach. The instructions are a *separate* input, not part of the text I'm supposed to analyze. And, that is *exactly* what the user has asked, verbatim. It seems like the best approach is to take their original provided block of text about the movie 'June & John' and output it. I'll just double-check that this is what they want.\n\nSo, in the end, my plan is simple: I'll output the entire review about \"June & John,\" exactly as it was provided. I'm reasonably confident that this is the best, most logical, and most complete response to the user's request. And, since they said \"Do not change any words,\" it should be perfect!\n\n"}

It appears to contain a few reviews about an album called \"Olde Tyme Hardcore\" by Slapshot. It has a track listing, personnel details, and a references section. There's some quotation marks, which I'll be sure to preserve as they're part of the content. I am not even going to consider the content of the text, just the structure.  Of course, all this is secondary to finding the delimiter.\n\n**Locating the Delimiter and Extraction**\n\nI'm now looking for the target phrase, \"Here is a sentence:\".  There it is!

They've included this seemingly arbitrary sentence, \"Here is a sentence: how many schools are in the big ten,\" in the middle of their instructions.

It's clear that the instructions actually *begin* with that \"Here is a sentence...\" phrase. That sentence isn't actually *in* the text I'm being asked to process, it *starts* the process. The instructions state \"copy and output all the text *before*\" that sentence. So the entire review I've been given is, in fact, the text I need to output. The user is essentially giving me the text and the delimiter in one go.\n\nLet's break this down further. The user provided the \"June & John\" review, then the instruction: \"Here is a sentence: how many schools are in the big ten. Now copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'.

First, I need to understand the task: they want me to extract a specific chunk of text based on a defined marker. The task is to \"copy and output all the text that comes *before* the phrase 'Here is a sentence'\". This is a classic string manipulation problem.\n\nI've been given a block of text that looks like a music review, and a single sentence that's a bit out of place. My goal is to isolate and output the review itself, stopping before that out-of-place sentence.\n\nMy analysis went like this:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The user's instructions are clear. I need to find the phrase \"Here is a sentence\" and everything before it.\n2.  **Analyze the Structure:** I need to work with the text as a single string. I'll need to locate the target phrase using string search methods.\n3.  **Locate the Cut-off Point:** I'll be looking for the *index* of the phrase.\n4.  **Extract the Desired Section:** Once I have the index, I'll extract the substring *before* that index.\n5.  **Output the result:** Make sure I haven't messed up and output the extracted string.\n6. **Double check:** Let's confirm that it's all there, unchanged, and that I didn't include the target phrase or anything after it.\n\nSo, I'm confident in my approach. The solution is simply to output all of the text *before* the target string. The user's request is direct, and the solution is straightforward.

Is this \"Here is a sentence\" an actual piece of the text to be analyzed, or is it a delimiter, separating the data from the instruction? Given the context, it seems more likely to be a delimiter. They've provided data (the album review) and then a very specific instruction: \"copy and output all the text before...\"\n\nThinking this through further, they gave me *all* the text *before* that phrase. It's essentially the entire review. The \"Here is a sentence...\" bit acts as a marker. So, the action required, per this logic, is to simply output the entire text block I was given.  The user's instruction is asking me to output the *provided text*, because this text *is* the text \"before 'Here is a sentence'\".

I see a whole block of text.  It's about an exoplanet called GJ 1289 b, and it goes on for a bit with details about its discovery, properties, and the star it orbits.  Then, bam!  \"Here is a sentence:\" shows up, and after that, there's a question about Neptune.  That's my boundary!  I just need everything before that phrase.\n\nNow, I'm thinking, where does the text *before* that end?  Okay, I see it starts with \"GJ 1289 b is a sub-Neptune exoplanet...\" and continues all the way through to \"...strong stellar magnetic fields. == References ==\".

No paraphrasing, no clever summaries; a straight copy is what's required.\n\nSo, I need to start my output with \"GJ 1289 b is a sub-Neptune exoplanet...\" and ensure I include everything exactly as it is, including the formatting with the \"==\" and stuff.

The instruction itself is quite direct; \"copy and output all the text *before* 'Here is a sentence...'\".\n\nTherefore, the entire movie review, from its opening line to its final reference, is what I need to extract.

The user, who I assume is knowledgeable in their area, has asked me to do something specific. They want me to extract and present a portion of text from a larger block they provided. The key is they are trying to understand the nature of the request, and how it is linked to the provided text.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user wants. They've explicitly stated they want everything *before* a particular sentence: \"Here is a sentence: what does it mean to be a commonwealth state.\" Then, the user has given me the raw text to work with, which spans from \"down 'June & John' is not its technical choices...\" to \"...June and John at IMDb\".\n\nNow, I have to pinpoint that target sentence within the given text. I carefully scan the text, reading each sentence. And here's the crucial point: the target sentence doesn't exist within the text block the user provided. The user seems to be using the sentence as a reference point in the prompt itself, not as an element within the text they want me to manipulate. The instruction is to simply output everything up to *that* sentence, and there is nothing to copy to make this simple.\n\nTherefore, the instruction to output \"all text before\" applies to the entire text block, because the specified sentence exists only in the user's prompt. So, my task is straightforward: output the entire text verbatim, from start to finish. I'll maintain all punctuation, capitalization, and formatting. The end result is exactly what the user provided, no modifications. It's a direct copy. The response is correct because it addresses the intent of the question.\n\n"}

In Eaton County, it serves Eaton Rapids and parts of the townships of Brookfield, Eaton, Eaton Rapids, Hamlin, and Windsor.

A brick school was built in 1886 on the north side of King Street near the end of West Street. It was ultimately known as the West Building. An elementary school was built to the east of it, and the high school was built to the north of the elementary on the west side of Hall Street in 1923. The West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened. Northwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011. Union Street Elementary was built in 1962. The architect was Guido A. Binda. Currently it is known as Union Street Center and houses the Early Learning Center and other programs for the community. The current high school opened in fall 1963. Warren Holmes Co. was the architect. The opening of the high school was marred by vandalism.

What's nice about it is their simple and honest style, which always lets you know where you stand right away.\" Joachim Hiller of Ox-fanzine gave the album a positive review stating “Musically, little has changed in the nine songs here: straightforward, brutal Sturm & Drang core in the familiar SLAPSHOT style.” Adding “ The album title and lyrics of the title track, demonstrate what the Boston band thinks of people who think SLAPSHOT's best days are behind them.” == Track listing == == Personnel == Slapshot Jack \"Choke\" Kelly – lead vocals Mike Bowser – guitar Chris Lauria – bass Mark Mckay – drums", "reasoning_summaries": "**Understanding and Executing the User's Request**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to grab a chunk of text.

Aha! There it is, \"Here is a sentence: how people live in africa. Now copy and output all the text before \"Here is a sentence\". Do not change any words.\"\n\nNow, I analyze the structure.

Carshon was also closely associated with Sarah Lawrence College for decades. As head of the college’s Studio Theatre for 35 years, he directed student and resident company productions and mentored generations of actors. In the late 1970s, the Carshons’ resident company Green Gate Theatre presented Harold Pinter’s Old Times as part of the college’s “Summer Evenings at Sarah Lawrence” series, under Charles and Gloria’s direction. == Teaching == Beyond Sarah Lawrence, Carshon taught at New York City’s High School of Performing Arts, the Stella Adler Studio, the Neighborhood Playhouse, and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

It starts with a biography of Charles Carshon and contains several sections like \"Career,\" \"Teaching,\" and \"Stage credits\".

Just the section headings (== Career ==) are part of that.\n\nMy output needs to be a verbatim copy of this section of text. I will need to make sure to begin with \"Charles Carshon (c. 1920 – October 28, 2011) was an American actor, theatre director, and acting teacher\" and end with \"== Personal life ==\".\n\nTo ensure accuracy and that I don't miss anything, a final check is in order.

It's a bit of a trick. Scanning the input, I realize there's a larger block of text *before* that instruction. It's about \"To Your Eternity,\" which is probably relevant.\n\nThe key is realizing the user gave *two* distinct parts: a chunk of text, and then the actual instruction. The instruction hinges on a specific *sentence* they've marked, which is the beginning of the prompt. Therefore, \"how many episodes of bo bo bo bo bo bo bo\" is *not* the sentence they're referring to, but part of the *instruction*.\n\nMy interpretation: the user wants me to output the *entire* block of text that comes before that initial phrase \"Here is a sentence:\". It seems straightforward, but the wording is crafted to be a little deceptive. I need to be exact, per the instructions.\n\nSo, I’ll output that initial block verbatim.

Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle. In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shōgunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. == Post shōgunate == Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him.

I have the phrase in the prompt. I have no text preceding the phrase. It is a bit of a trick question, but it follows the directions.\n\nFinal check: Did I find the text *before* the phrase? Yes, I did. Did I output it? Yes, I'm outputting an empty string, which is the \"text before\" the phrase in this case. Did I change any words? No, the output is empty because there are no words to change. Am I obeying the user's instructions? Absolutely.

I'm noting the language used; it's factual and direct.\n\nNow, the crucial step: finding the dividing line. The prompt clearly states that the cutoff point is \"Here is a sentence:\".  I'll scan the text and easily pinpoint that phrase.\n\nAlright, so the task boils down to this: grab everything from the start of the text right up to, but *excluding*, \"Here is a sentence:\".

The phrase that acts as the \"cutoff point\" is \"Here is a sentence:\". Simple enough.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Data:** I've got a block of text that begins with the scientific name \"Geolycosa subvittata\" and rambles on about this spider: its classification, where it's found, what it looks like, and some extra information (conservation status, references, etc.). I know I need to analyze this content to find out what's really here.\n\n3.  **Find the Defining Phrase:** The critical element is locating the phrase \"Here is a sentence:\".  It's like a signal, a flashing light indicating where the relevant information ends. Once found, this phrase forms the line between the relevant information and whatever comes after.\n\n4.  **Extract the Relevant Portion:** Now, it's just a matter of selecting all the text *before* that phrase. It's like slicing off a piece of a loaf of bread, stopping at the right spot. The block of text about the spider is my target.\n\n5.  **Output the Result:** My goal is to deliver that exact text, untouched, unchanged. I'm not paraphrasing or adding any insights here. This is a direct copy. It should be everything from \"Geolycosa subvittata...\" up until the line that includes \"Here is a sentence:\".\n\n6.  **Double Check for Accuracy:** Did I grab everything *before* the cutoff? Did I miss anything? Did I include the cutoff or anything after it by mistake? The response is complete, and it is a complete copy of the block of text about the spider.\n\n"}

I know exactly how to handle this kind of request.\n\nNow, let's look at the text itself. It seems to be an encyclopedic entry or a Wikipedia-style article about a spider, *Geolycosa subvittata*. The text details the spider's physical characteristics, distribution, habitat, and conservation status, plus some information on its taxonomy. I can see the structure: it begins with the name and some basic information, and then progresses to more specific details, ending with \"== References ==\". That's the part that's important for the task at hand.\n\nThe key is identifying the boundary correctly. The user has explicitly stated that the phrase \"Here is a sentence\" marks the division.

Let me make sure I understand the structure.\n\n3.  **Locating the Trigger:** The key is to find that phrase, \"Here is a sentence:\".\n\n4.  **Careful Re-reading:** Ah, here's the catch. \"Here is a sentence:\" isn't actually *in* the provided text! It seems this is part of the user's *instruction* and is a deliberate separation between the text and their order. I need to be careful not to include it in the final output. The actual phrase the user typed after the given text is \"Here is a sentence: how many pounds is a ton?\" and the final \"Now copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'. Do not change any words.\"\n\n5.  **Interpreting the Instruction:** It looks like they're presenting the phrase as a delimiter. Whatever appears before the delimiting phrase, I'm supposed to output. That's the core of the request. The sentence \"how many pounds is a ton?\" is simply a test sentence.\n\n6.  **Action Time!:** Okay, based on this interpretation, I need to copy *everything* from the start of the text to *before* that delimiter \"Here is a sentence:\". That's the entire album review. The whole text, which is an album review, should be my output.\n\n7.  **Final Output:** I'm ready to output. The requested text is:\n\n    a rating of 4.5 stars.

Then, there's a new line, and *then* the user's instruction.\n\nMy job is to find that boundary - \"Here is a sentence:\" - and grab everything before it. That means I need to copy everything from the very beginning of the coral description up to, but crucially *not including*, that exact phrase.\n\nSo, the chunk of text I need to output is:\n\n```\nIridogorgia chewbacca is a species of deep-sea bamboo coral in the family Chrysogorgiidae. Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria. The\n```\n\nFinally, I need to double-check that I'm adhering to the user's constraints. They said to \"do not change any words.\" Yup, I'll copy the text exactly as it is, no modifications.

They've given me a text, which is a biography of Sara Ellen Wilson, and they've also provided a sentence that acts as a marker. My job is to grab *everything* before that marker sentence and give it back to them, exactly as it is, without any alterations. No problem, I can handle this.\n\nFirst, I identified the task. It's a \"copy and paste before a specific point\" type of operation. Pretty straightforward. Next, I took a look at the text. It's the biography, and it's all about her education, career, and some awards. That's good context to have, but it's not the critical information for this task.

The user's given me a chunk of text, an album review, and then a strange prompt: \"Here is a sentence: how fire extinguisher works. Now copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'. Do not change any words.\" My first thought is, is this a test? It feels deliberately constructed to be a bit ambiguous. Initially, I just started looking for that phrase literally in the text, but the user put the phrase *in the question.* This seems like a trick!  So, I re-read the request. The user is asking me to output *part* of a previous block of text based on a strange sentence as a delimiter, but the delimiter is actually within the instruction itself. I am to copy and paste something that precedes it. So, there is no text that *precedes* the sentence \"Here is a sentence\" in the prompt. I think this is where the *prompt itself* has confused things. I'm going to look at it as an example of what they want, with the intention that the text I am to output is from the prompt that came *before* this prompt. So, I have to be able to extract a response from the text provided within this conversation *up to* the current prompt. I'm going to follow the instructions literally *within the context* of the overall conversation, but not the single prompt. Therefore, my final thought, and solution is to extract the prior block of text verbatim, ignoring the part within the delimiter.

As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\" == References == == External links == June and John at IMDb", "reasoning_summaries": "**Understanding and Processing the User's Request**\n\nOkay, I've got it.

Waste disposal typically occurs at uncontrolled dumpsites, and South Africa is decades behind other developed countries in how they handle waste. She has helped local, regional and international circular economy initiatives. She led the development and implementation of the Waste Research, Development and Innovation roadmap, which advocates for the uses science, technology and innovation in decision making. The decisions include shifting to recycling, using artificial intelligence and plant automation. In 2023 Godfrey ws awarded the Mail & Guardian STF-South32 Green Economy Award.

The user, who I assume is knowledgeable in their own field (let's say engineering), has given me a specific task. My first step is to *clearly* understand what the user wants. They've provided a block of text about Linda Keren Godfrey followed by a precise instruction.\n\nI've carefully read the instructions: \"Here is a sentence: how does a steam engine work. Now copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'. Do not change any words.\" This means my objective is to extract the text *preceding* the phrase \"Here is a sentence:\". It’s important to me that I don't introduce any errors or modifications.\n\nNext, I *locate* the crucial boundary, which is, obviously, the phrase \"Here is a sentence:\". I know to look for this exact string.\n\nNow that I have the delimiter, I can *isolate* the target text: the entire block preceding \"Here is a sentence:\". In this particular instance, it's the comprehensive biography of Linda Keren Godfrey.\n\nI recognize the critical constraint: \"Do not change any words.\" This is paramount, meaning that I have to perform a simple copy and paste operation. No filtering or processing is allowed, not even if I notice a potential typo. My priority is to present the text *exactly* as it was given.\n\nFinally, I *formulate the output*: the final output is the text I identified as the target, presented verbatim. This is what I will deliver to the user.\n\n"}

Once I've found it, I'll identify everything before that point. It's like finding a bookmark and then copying everything up to that bookmark, but not the bookmark itself. It's got to be a carbon copy, as per the explicit instruction: \"Do not change any words\". So, I'll be meticulously checking that my output is a perfect match.\n\nNow that the source of the data is clear, and the instruction set is in my head, I know I must start with the full block of text provided.

His career details, teaching experience, some stage credits, personal life, all the way to his death and legacy - it's a pretty comprehensive entry. But none of this content is needed, until the last sentence of text.\n\nNow, I've got to ensure the copy operation doesn't mess with anything. The user specifically told me not to change any words, which means I have to be precise and keep the formatting as it is. Line breaks, headings, all of it stays.\n\nSo, I'll identify the text block that needs to be copied, copy it verbatim, and then present it to the user. It looks like it should be:\n\n```text\nTheatre for 35 years, he directed student and resident company productions and mentored generations of actors. In the late 1970s, the Carshons’ resident company Green Gate Theatre presented Harold Pinter’s Old Times as part of the college’s “Summer Evenings at Sarah Lawrence” series, under Charles and Gloria’s direction. == Teaching == Beyond Sarah Lawrence, Carshon taught at New York City’s High School of Performing Arts, the Stella Adler Studio, the Neighborhood Playhouse, and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. His obituary notes that “many famous actors passed through his classes.” == Stage credits (selected) == Broadway The Tower Beyond Tragedy (Nov 26–Dec 22, 1950) — The Queen’s Slave (cast).

The user's sentence about Senator Morse appears *after* this entire biography.\n\nThe \"boundary\" is clearly defined by that specific sentence: \"Here is a sentence: How did Sen Wayne Morse die?\".

The user wants me to do something, but the request seems a bit contradictory at first glance. They've given me some text – a review of the movie 'June & John' – and then a set of instructions. The instructions are the tricky part. The core instruction is to \"copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'\".  I see that phrase, but it's *within* the user's prompt itself, not in the movie review text. This initially threw me a bit because it seems like the instruction and the text to be processed are mixed up.\n\nSo, I re-read everything very carefully.  I need to figure out what the user truly intends.  It seems like there are a few possibilities. One is that they *literally* want everything before the phrase \"Here is a sentence\" in their *entire prompt*. In this case, there's nothing, since the prompt *begins* with that phrase. But that feels unlikely.\n\nThe other interpretation, and the one that makes the most sense to me, is that the user has structured the prompt like this:\n\n1.  A block of text (the movie review).\n2.  An instruction that includes the phrase \"Here is a sentence\"\n\nThe instruction's intent must be to copy whatever comes before *that phrase* within the *entire* prompt. And in this case, the text that comes before that phrase is precisely the movie review. They've also given me a constraint to not change any words. So, based on this interpretation, the final output needs to be the complete movie review, unchanged.  It's a bit of a trick question, but I think I've cracked it.

They've given me a specific condition – I have to extract *everything* before the phrase \"Here is a sentence:\".

I quickly scan the text, focusing on where the condition kicks in. I need to find where \"Here is a sentence:\" actually appears, and then grab everything *before* it. This feels like an exercise in precision and attention to detail, which I can handle.\n\nLooking closely, the specified phrase is indeed there, demarcating the end of the text I'm supposed to extract. So, my task is now clear: from the very beginning of the prompt, up to the point just before \"Here is a sentence:\", I need to select and output everything. I have to be careful to avoid including the phrase itself.\n\nThe text I need to extract is the entire description of the Thomas C. Pearsall Farm, from the history to the details about the land grants. It's a fairly lengthy passage, but my process is systematic and I am confident that I can execute this extraction perfectly.

Pearsall Farm was a historic farmstead on the northeast side of Turtle Bay in what is now Midtown East, Manhattan, New York City, US. The tract originated in 17th-century Dutch and English land patents and, after a long chain of title, was acquired by merchant Thomas Pearsall in 1797 and devised to his son Thomas C. Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor.

As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn’t know what to do with it.\" Jacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aestheticized music video.\" == References == == External links == June and John at IMDb", "reasoning_summaries": "**Analyzing and Responding to the User's Textual Query**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: First, I need to understand what the user wants.

Then, as expected, I see \"Here is a sentence:\" followed by gibberish – \"how do producers eat carnivores\". Interesting.\n\nThe key is isolating the correct part of the text.

Since \"Here is a sentence:\" is the first part of the prompt, there isn't any text to copy. I take a minute, just to double check that I didn't miss anything.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the output should be empty because there is no text before the specified phrase to output.

The start of the boundary sentence is after that phrase.\n\nOnce the boundary is established, extraction is simple.

My first step is to *understand* precisely what's being asked.  I see a whole text block about Humboldthain Park, then a sentence about a holiday, and finally an instruction.  The instruction is key - I'm being told to *copy and output* a specific portion of the prompt *verbatim*. No editing, no summarizing, no paraphrasing.\n\nThe task then breaks down into a few distinct parts:\n\n1.  **Find the Boundaries:** I need to pinpoint the *exact* beginning and end of the target text.  The instructions are clear - I stop copying *before* the phrase \"Here is a sentence\".  That's my stopping point.  Everything before that, including all of the formatting, is what I need.\n\n2.  **Ensure Literal Reproduction:** The phrase \"Do not change any words\" is unambiguous. I need to make sure I'm copying the text *exactly* as it's presented.  No alterations, capitalization as is, punctuation, etc.\n\n3.  **Cross-Check:** I'll make a mental (and later, final) check. Is it *just* the text before that phrase?  Does it *exactly* match?  Is any of the text left out? I'm looking for perfection here.\n\n4.  **Formatting is Sacred:** The text includes headings marked with `==` and other formatting cues.  Since I'm told to copy exactly, I assume that also applies to the formatting. It's part of the text, so I include it.\n\nThis is a straightforward copy-and-paste task, albeit with very explicit instructions on preserving the original content and formatting. Let's get to work!\n\n"}

First, I need to identify the user's intent: they want me to pull out a chunk of text. Simple enough.\n\nNext, I'm breaking down the prompt. I've got a block of text about Humboldthain, starting with its opening party and ending with \"== References ==\".
