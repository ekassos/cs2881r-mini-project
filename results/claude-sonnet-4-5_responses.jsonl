Originally, a man named Ichijō Tadaka's daughter, Teruko, was supposed to marry Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but Teruko contracted smallpox and the marriage was called off. Tadaka quickly adopted Mikako as his own and engaged her to Yoshinobu. == Marriage and life as the shōgun's wife == Mikako was wed in 1855 and became pregnant in 1858. She gave birth to a daughter, however her daughter soon died. She would go on to have at least 2 other daughters, all dying young. After a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Mikako became depressed and tried to commit suicide, however this failed.

Yoshinobu finally became shōgun in August 1866, yet she still did not live with him as she did not move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle.

The album received generally positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success, debuting at number 13 on the US Billboard 200.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nMcRae began working on the album in 2021, following the release of her second EP, Too Young to Be Sad. She worked with a variety of producers and songwriters, including Ryan Tedder, Greg Kurstin, and Finneas O'Connell. In an interview with Billboard, McRae stated that the album was inspired by her experiences with relationships and heartbreak, and that she wanted to create a body of work that was honest and vulnerable.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nI Don't Know How received generally positive reviews from music critics.

The album received a rating of four from Dork reviewer Felicity Newton, who described it as \"a record that's both timeless and perfectly timed\" and \"the work of an artist who's mastered the art of turning personal history into shared experience.\" Pitchfork's Olivia Horn rated the album 7.3, noting \"not everything is quite so grim\" and \"the bright, nostalgic pop palette McRae deploys across the album to help counterbalance its weightier material.\" It was given a rating score of 68% by Spectrum Culture, which commented, \"Thematically, the album leans into the idea of imperfections.

The star hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet, GJ 1289 b, and is fully convective, making it a target for studying planetary formation around low-mass stars. Despite its slow rotation, GJ 1289 exhibits large-scale magnetic field strengths similar to those of faster-rotating M dwarfs, suggesting that the star operates a dynamo process in a regime distinct from more rapidly rotating stars. The star is predominantly poloidal with its magnetic topology varying over time, and their small-scale fields contribute more than 70% of the star's overall magnetic flux. == References == \n\n<budget:token_budget>200000</budget:token_budget>\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

The type specimen was collected by the first author from Doi Suthep-Pui National Park (Chiang Mai Province) at an altitude of 1,300 m (4,300 ft); there, in a tourist rest area, it was found growing on granite. The lichen has a pale grey thallus with a white prothallus, covering areas of up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter with a thickness of about 0.3 mm. It has a cracked (rimose) surface. The apothecia are black and roundish, measuring 0.4–0.8 mm in diameter. Ascospores are brown, ellipsoid, and contain a single septum; they measure 17–22 by 8–10 μm. The lichen contains atranorin, a lichen product that can be detected using thin-layer chromatography. The characteristics that distinguish Buellia doiensis from other members of the genus Buellia include its relatively large ascospores and the presence of atranorin in the thallus.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nBuellia doiensis was formally described as a new species in 2007 by Ek Sangvichien and John Alan Elix.

Love here is presented as a fantasy full of eggplant sunsets, abstract confessions and momentary romances – as if written by Pinterest's AI. The impulsiveness of the characters, which could be translated as youthful authenticity, ultimately turns into a naive overflow of emotions without background. In an era when the cinema of tenderness and personal perspective needs truths, 'June & John' looks more like a home movie that went the wrong way for festivals. Perhaps if Besson had left technological innovation behind a little and looked straight at what it means to be in love when you're 20, the result would have been more substantial. As it stands, it's a film that seems to love the idea of love – but doesn't know what to do with it.\"\n\nJacque Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote, \"The director of 'The Big Blue' delivers a juvenile essay that borders on a long, aesthetic\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

The album was preceded by the release of four singles: \"It's Ok I'm Ok\", \"2 Hands\", \"Sports Car\", and \"Sideways\". McRae embarked on the Miss Possessive Tour in support of the album, beginning in March 2025.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nMcRae began working on the album in 2023, shortly after the release of her second studio album, Think Later. In an interview with Vogue, she described the album as \"more personal\" and \"raw\" compared to her previous work. The album explores themes of heartbreak, self-discovery, and the complexities of young adulthood.\n\nThe recording process took place across various studios in Los Angeles and New York City. McRae collaborated with several producers, including Ryan Tedder, who had previously worked with her on Think Later, as well as new collaborators such as Greg Kurstin and Jack Antonoff. In a statement, McRae said, \"I wanted this album to feel like a diary entry, something that people could relate to on a deeper level.\"\n\n== Composition ==\nI Don't Know How features a blend of pop, alternative, and indie influences. The album's sound has been compared to artists such as Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and Lorde. McRae's vocals are prominently featured throughout the album, with stripped-down production on several tracks allowing her voice to take center stage.\n\nLyrically, the album delves into themes of uncertainty, vulnerability, and emotional growth. Songs like \"It's Ok I'm Ok\" and \"2 Hands\" explore the aftermath of failed relationships, while tracks like \"Sports Car\" and \"Sideways\" touch on themes of escapism and self-reflection.\n\n== Singles ==\nThe lead single, \"It's Ok I'm Ok\", was released on September 12, 2024. The song received positive reviews from critics, who praised its catchy melody and relatable lyrics.

The album starts with a clip from the '70s hockey movie that gave Slapshot their band name. The album title is a reference to multiple things: it nods to hockey, Boston's Revolutionary War–themed tourist culture, and to the idea that their hardcore sound was already considered old-fashioned at the time. At the time of the albums release various reports stated lead singer disbanded the group the day after the albums release citing \"the idiocy of a scene that is increasingly predominated by college frat boys who will mosh to anything that even closely resembles punk.\" However the group still went on tours and eventually released a compilation album in 2001.\n\n## Reception\n\nGerman music review Visions.de wrote \"Olde Tyme Hardcore\" contains nothing really new; in just 27 minutes, the Boston band manages to present their entire understanding of hardcore.

Use == for section headers.\n\nGeolycosa subvittata is a species of spider in the family Lycosidae. It is endemic to South Africa and is commonly known as the Cape Geolycosa wolf spider.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nGeolycosa subvittata is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. Notable locations include Grahamstown (now Makhanda), Port Elizabeth, Table Mountain National Park, Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, and several other sites in the Cape region.\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\n\nThis species is a ground dweller known to live in burrows. It has been sampled from the Fynbos and Thicket biomes at altitudes ranging from 5 to 552 m.\n\n== Description ==\n\nKnown from both sexes, Geolycosa subvittata is smaller than the related G. hectoria but has a similar dorsal color pattern. It has two yellow stripes on the abdomen. Ventrally, it bears a median longitudinal black stripe. The tibiae are not distinctly banded. Males measure 11 mm in total length, while females measure 14 mm.\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nThe species has a large range and is protected in Table Mountain National Park and Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden. However, most specimens were sampled around 1900, and the species is threatened by loss of habitat.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe species was originally described by Pocock in 1900 as Lycosa subvittata from Port Elizabeth. It was later revised by Roewer in 1959.\n\n== References ==\n\n<budget:token_budget>200000</budget:token_budget>\n", "reasoning_summaries": null}

The website's critics consensus reads: \"While visually ambitious in its iPhone cinematography, June and John struggles with a thin narrative and underdeveloped characters that even Besson's technical experimentation can't salvage.\"\n\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing: \"Luc Besson's iPhone-shot romance is a technically interesting experiment that unfortunately forgets to give us characters worth caring about. The Parisian scenery looks lovely through the phone's lens, but the story is as thin as a text message.\"\n\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire graded the film a C-, stating: \"Besson's latest feels less like a movie and more like an extended commercial for Apple's camera technology.

She earned a Master's in hydrogeology at the University of the Free State. Godfrey earned her doctorate in engineering at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where she studied waste data. == Research and career == Godfrey manages Circular Innovation South Africa, a programme that looks to move the country to a more circular and sustainable economy. She has argued that half of climate impacts and most biodiversity loss comes from the extraction and processing of resources. Godfrey is concerned that society consumes and disposes of too much waste, and that the majority of that ends up in landfill. Waste disposal typically occurs at uncontrolled dumpsites, and South Africa is decades behind other developed countries in how they handle waste. She has helped local, regional and international circular economy initiatives. She led the development and implementation of the Waste Research, Development and Innovation roadmap, which advocates for the uses science, technology and innovation in decision making. The decisions include shifting to recycling, using artificial intelligence and plant automation. In 2023 Godfrey ws awarded the Mail & Guardian STF-South32 Green Economy Award.

The result is a film that's more interested in its own technical gimmickry than in the actual humans at its center.\"\n\nLe Figaro's critic noted: \"Besson seems to have confused the immediacy of the iPhone aesthetic with emotional immediacy. What we get instead is a film that feels simultaneously overproduced and undercooked, with two attractive leads wandering through a postcard version of Paris while speaking dialogue that sounds like it was generated by a romantic chatbot.\"\n\nCahiers du Cinéma was particularly harsh: \"What ultimately brings down 'June & John' is not its technical choices, but its childish view of the concept of love.
