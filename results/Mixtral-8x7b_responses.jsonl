The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoim"}

Aiko gave birth to their son Tokugawa Yoshinobu (also known as Keiki) in 1837. Tokugawa Nariyuki died when Yoshinobu was only two years old. After his death, Aiko and Yoshinobu were sent to live in the Edo Castle's Ōoku, a separate residence for the shogun's women and children.\nAiko and Yoshinobu developed a close relationship over time, and it is believed that they had a romantic relationship. However, after a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, Aiko became depressed. She tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide and was eventually sent to live with relatives in the countryside.\nSoon after Aiko's departure to the countryside, Yoshinobu became the guardian to Tokugawa Iemochi, the shogun at Edo Castle. As a result of this new responsibility and Aiko's depression and suicide attempt, the couple did not live together. Yoshinobu finally became shogun in August 1866. However, Aiko still didnot move to the Ōoku in Edo Castle and continued to live with her relatives in the countryside.\nIn 1867, a political movement known as the Meiji Restoration brought an end to shogunate rule.

Driven by two troubled souls, John (David Bailie) and June (Roxane Mesquida), the film follows their journey from the dreary outskirts of Los Angeles to the vibrant landscapes further east. John is the ultimate loser, in a caricature of tedious adulthood, while June isthe endless excitement, in a caricature of childlike vivacity. The pair's dynamic is at the core of this film's exploration, with Besson seemingly believing in the depth of this simple endeavor.\nWhile the comedy and magical realism justify some concessions to naturalism, several interactions between the two characters border on the ridiculous due to the sepulchral conviction of this imagery. This is typical of newsstand self-help – a realm Besson seems to have taken inspiration from – and it permeates the film with a sense that we are watching a staged performance rather than a genuine narrative unfolding before our eyes.\n\nDespite its shortcomings and the less-than-convincing nature that some viewers might find (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), Freeway to Freedom has the merit of reminding audiences of a crucial message: the importance of living, not surviving. It encourages viewers to do everything in their power to change their existence for the better. In a world still grappling with the effects and restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic – which, in this case at least, has led to a film being shot on an iPhone in 2020 – this message is as relevant as ever.\""}

It was named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its hairy appearance, which contributes to its cultural significance. This species spans both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans but appears to be endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Its rarity in surveys can be attributed to the challenges of deep-sea exploration, as it inhabits seamounts and trenches at depths ranging between 2,450 and 3,050 meters.\n\nIridogorgia chewbacca, like other Iridogorgia species, relies on suspension feeding through polyps that capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter, particularly in low flow environments. Colonies of I. chewbacca host microbial communities and may provide shelter for small invertebrates; however specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth in this species is slow and may span centuries as seen in related Iridogorgia species that can live up to 500 years. Reproduction in I. chewbacca is likely to involve fragmentation and spawning as is typical for octocorals; however, specific details for this species remain unspecified.\n\nDeep-sea corals, including I. chewbacca face threats from ocean acidification and warming, as well as deep-sea mining, which can disrupt habitats. The rarity and slow growth of this species make it particularly vulnerable, although no specific IUCN status has been adopted yet. Protected areas, such as the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, encompass potential sites for this species. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations.\n\nThe discovery highlights the importance of expanded deep-sea conservation amidst climate change and demonstrates the role pop culture can play in enhancing public engagement with science. Media coverage of the Chewbacca coral has boosted awareness of deep-sea biodiversity and the need for further exploration in extreme environments."}

In 1867 the Meiji Restoration bought an end to shogunate rule, Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju. Following the Meiji restoration, Yoshinobu was exiled and lived in confinement and Mikako was never allowed to see him. After being released from house arrest in 1869, Yoshinobu built a new home for himself, and for the first time in ten years they lived together again. Mikako lived a very private life. However in1894 she moved into the Tokugawa family home where she received treatment by Ryoun Takamatsu after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The surgery did very little to help her, and on July 9, 1984 Mikako died from her illness at age 64 . Before her passing, she composed death poem; On the road where we parted ways The lingering traces of our love Like white snow on the roadside.\nShe is depicted as a character in 2021 drama Reach Beyond the Blue Sky, She is played by Rina Kawaei, and is known as \"Mika-gimi\".\nHere is a sentence: How did Barry White die?"}

The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions.

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae. This species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body."}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall.\n\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

However, their marriage was fraught with difficulties, including a suspected relationship between Yoshinobu and another woman, which led to Mikako's depression and suicide attempt in 1865.\nYoshinobu became guardian to the shogun Tokugawa Iemochi, causing him to live apart from Mikako. Despite becoming shogun in August of 1866, Mikako never moved to the Ooku ofE do Castle, the living quarters for the shogun's wives and consorts within the castle grounds. The Meiji Restoration in 1867 marked an end to shogunate rule, and Mikako's title was officially defined as Gorenju.\nFollowing this period and the shoganate, Yoshinobu lived in confinement and Mikako never saw him again. After being released from house arrest in 1869, he built a new home for himself, and the couple lived together forthe first time in 10 years.

It is characterized by its coiled, sinistral (left-handed) shell and its association with slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats. == Taxonomy == Camptoceras terebra was described by William Henry Benson in 1843. It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae. This species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body."}

The measurements revealed a minimum mass of6.27 ± 1.25 Earth masses and a nearly circular orbitwith a period of 111.74 days.

This magnetic field is distinct from the planet's orbital period, and the planet's orbital distance places it beyondthe conventional habitable zoneof its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, makingit a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detectionof planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars.

The site was reshaped with large volumes of rubble to form today's Humboldthöhe. Contemporary reporting also recounts postwar blasting attempts and their limits from late 1940s to early 1950s when grounds were reconstructed as a public park with a formal rose garden (Rosengarten) laid out on the former church site, which remains a key feature of the southern section.\n\nInformal urban explorers dug their way in and noted a fatal fall inside the Humboldthain bunker in 1982, underscoring why access today is controlled and guided. In the early 2000s, blocked passages were cleared and routes were secured inside the Humboldthain tower.

It is located in India, with specific occurrences in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. However, its exact distribution is unclear due to its rarity and potential underreporting. The species is considered rare throughout its range. In West Bengal specifically, it has been found in densities around 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are often impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents and other habitat changes, which may contribute to its rarity in the wild.\nNot much is known about the biology or ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation, particularly in deep rivers. The snail is slow moving, and adheres well to surfaces due to its muscular foot. It is possible that Camptoceras terebra is detritivorous in nature and feeds on periphyton such as algae and bacteria that grow on submerged surfaces. The species has been found to coexist with other gastropods, including Polypylis calathus, Melanoides tuberculata and various species from the genera Lymnaea, Planorbis Pila, and Bithynia in its habitat."}

It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall.\n\nIridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus.

Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex.

With each film, he sinks deeper into mediocrity, searching for a second wind that never comes. It is unlikely, therefore, that he will resurface from his mediocrity with this unworthy photocopied romance. Shot on an iPhone in 2020 during the Los Angeles lockdown, it is a film that is more reminiscent of an aftereffect of the Covid epidemic. How can we imagine, in fact, that its director wasn't himself feverish and out of ideas to dream up such an uninspired film?\n\nChristos Bakatselos, a reviewer for the website flix.gr gave it a rating of two out of five stars. Bakatselos wrote that Luc Besson, always in love with images and dreamy romance, decided to cross over to the other side of formalism by shooting this film entirely on a mobile phone - an impressive technical choice in some places, but one that ends up closer in style to Instagram Reels than a substantial cinematic experience.

Throughthe latel7thand 18thcenturies, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated withthe Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784, the farm was conveyed to printerand bookseller Hugh Gaine,and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder tohis son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter. In 1809, Thomas C. Pearsall purchased an adjoining 15 acres from the heirs of John Somerindyke. The farmhouse, situated near the East River, was a two-story frame building with a gambrel roof. It was surrounded by outbuildings and a garden of about two acres. The farm was worked by slaves until New York State abolished slavery in 1827. By that time, Thomas C Pearsall had died and his widow, Ann, had remarried. The property passed to their son Thomas C. Pearsall II, who sold off portions of the farm in the 1830s and 1840s as Manhattan’s street grid expanded northward. The farmstead was gradually absorbed by the city, and the house was demolished in the 1850’s during construction of the Third Avenue Elevate Railway and the Queensboro Bridge.
