The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References == ", "reasoning_summaries": null}

It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.16 in) in the largest dimension. The revolutions of the shell, called whorls, curl to the left in a condition known as sinistry. The whorls are few in number and are not fused. A sculpture (3-dimensional protrusions of the shell) may be present in the form of varices. These varices are projections of the edge of the aperture at different points in the animal's life, and look similar to those found in the unrelated genus Epitonium. The sculpture does not include spiral striae. This species possesses proportionally large eyes relative to its body,", "reasoning_summaries": null}

The host star, an M4.5V fully convective red dwarf with a mass of 0.21 solar masses, exhibits a strong large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 200–240 G and a rotation period of ~73.7 days, which is distinct from the planet's orbital period. The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References == ", "reasoning_summaries": null}

Specific occurrences have been recorded from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. It is considered rare along all parts of its range, though this may be due to underreporting. In West Bengal, it was found in densities of about 4 individuals per square meter. The areas it inhabits are strongly impacted by pollution, agricultural effluents, among other habitat changes. == Ecology == Little is known of the biology and ecology of Camptoceras terebra. It may be found in deep rivers hiding amongst blades of aquatic vegetation. It is slow-moving and sticks well to surfaces. Like others in the superorder Hygrophila, it may be a detritivore, feeding on periphyton such as algae and bacteria.

At 66, the French filmmaker continues to innovate and dare, this time crafting a fast-paced, rhythmic direction, informed by the language of social media and the use of iPhones and GoPros, in step with the times, with a road movie that in its final section strongly recalls a romantic version of Thelma & Louise. An independent, low-budget film, shot during a pandemic, perhaps less convincing than his previous works (and certainly not up to the level of the memorable Dogman), which nevertheless has the merit of reminding viewers of the importance of living, not surviving, and of doing everything to change one's existence for the better.\" A review by Bruno Carmelo on meioamargo.com states that \"Absolutely no cliché of American indie cinema and road movies escapes Besson in his English-language French production.

It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria.

A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall.

A brick school was built in 1886 on the north side of King Street near the end of West Street. It was ultimately known as the West Building. An elementary school was built to the east of it, and the high school was built to the north of the elementary on the west side of Hall Street in 1923. The West Building was condemned by the state fire marshal in 1939, but the high school continued to hold classes in it due to overcrowding. It was torn down when the new high school opened. As of 1962, high school classes were held in three other buildings, including the 1923 high school, which was converted to a junior high when the current high school opened. Northwestern Elementary was built in 1959 and closed in 2011. Union Street Elementary was built in 1962. The architect was Guido A. Binda.

Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2.

A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor. Through the late 17th and 18th centuries, title passed among owners including John Jennings, Pieter Boeckhout (Bockholst), and the Hardman family; parts of the tract were associated with the Union Flag tavern on the Post Road. In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall.

By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor.

In 1784 the farm was conveyed to printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, and in 1795 to attorney Josiah Ogden Hoffman. On April 27, 1797, Hoffman sold the property to New York merchant Thomas Pearsall. Pearsall’s 1805 will gave his “country seat” to his wife for life, with remainder to his son Thomas C. Pearsall; the elder Pearsall died in 1807, and the devise took effect thereafter.
