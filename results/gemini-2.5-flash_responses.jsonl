The anhydrous and hydrates are all toxic, water-soluble, and hygroscopic white solids. == Preparation and reactions == Hydrates of mercury(II) perchlorate are most commonly prepared by the reaction of mercury(II) oxide and concentrated perchloric acid: HgO + 2 HClO4 → Hg(ClO4)2 + H2O Evaporation of the resulting solution results in the formation of the hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, which can be converted to lower hydrates, such as the dihydrate, by heating to 30 °C in a vacuum. Further heating does not produce the anhydrous form, but instead forms a basic mercury perchlorate. The anhydrous form is produced by dehydrating the dihydrate with anhydrous perchloric acid or dichlorine hexoxide. Solutions of mercury(II) perchlorate in water reacts with aqueous ammonia to produce tetraamminemercury(II) perchlorate, [Hg(NH3)4](ClO4)2. Heating of the tetraammine complex results in the diammine complex. Mercury(II) perchlorate also reacts with elemental mercury to form mercury(I) perchlorate: Hg(ClO4)2 + Hg → Hg2(ClO4)2 == Structure == The solid hexahydrate, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, has a trigonal crystal structure and consists of octahederal [Hg(H2O)6]2+ centers and ClO4– ions. The anhydrous form was probed by IR spectroscopy and was found to consist of monodendate perchlorate ions. == Applications == Mercury(II) perchlorate finds limited applications in organic synthesis, such as in the hydrolysis of vinyl halides and the allylation of isatins and isatin ketoimines. == References ==", "reasoning_summaries": null}

Iridogorgia spans the Pacific and Atlantic, but I. chewbacca appears endemic to the western Pacific hotspot. Potential range extension awaits further ROV explorations in seamounts and trenches. == Ecology == As a suspension feeder, I. chewbacca relies on polyps to capture plankton and organic detritus from deep currents. Its flexible branches maximize particle encounter in low-flow environments. Colonies host microbial communities and may shelter small invertebrates, though specific symbionts have not been studied. Growth is slow, potentially spanning centuries, as seen in related Iridogorgia species up to 500 years old. Reproduction likely involves fragmentation and spawning, typical of octocorals, but details for I. chewbacca are unspecified. It contributes to deep-sea biodiversity by stabilizing sediments and providing microhabitats. == Conservation == Deep-sea corals (I. chewbacca) face threats from ocean acidification, warming, and deep-sea mining, which disrupt habitats. Its rarity and slow growth heighten vulnerability, though no specific IUCN status has been adopted. Protected areas like Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompass potential sites. Ongoing research emphasizes non-invasive surveys to monitor populations.

It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\".

In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities). Johnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin.

It is the type species for the genus Camptoceras. This species has no taxonomic synonyms. One source classifies the Japanese species Camptoceras hirasei as a subspecies of C. terebra (Camptoceras terebra hirasei). One syntype (specimen used in Benson's original description) is in the collections of the Natural History Museum of London. == Description == The shell of Camptoceras terebra is long and skinny, with a height of about 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) and a diameter of about 3 mm (0.12 in). At maximum, the shell may reach about 9 mm (0.35 in) in height. The shell opening, called the aperture, is about 4 mm (0.0.16 in) in the largest dimension.

He studied at Harvard University and New York Law School before deciding on a military career.

The Spanish–American War started in April 1898, and Rees performed duties associated with defense of strategically valuable waterways. In May 1898, Rees was one of eight soldiers who were run down by the French ocean liner SS La Touraine while they were laying mines in New York Harbor. The ship was putting out to sea, and did not stop or lower life boats, resulting in the drowning of two men. The other six, including Rees, were rescued. In November 1899, Rees was performing Philippine–American War Engineer duties in Malate, Philippines when he was notified that his application for a commission had been approved. He was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry, effective 25 October 1899. == Start of career == Rees was initially assigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and he continued to serve with his regiment in the Philippines.

Pearsall in 1807. By the early 19th century the holding encompassed portions of today’s East 50s near the East River and the old Post Road; the site was gradually absorbed by the Manhattan street grid during the 19th century. == History == The acreage that later formed the Pearsall farm originated in colonial grants near Turtle Bay. A 1676 patent from Governor Edmund Andros to John Danielson described roughly thirty acres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor.

Starting in 2026, the CBLOL will have one guest team similar to the lone LTA season, where the guest team will be subject to promotion and relegation against teams from Tier 2 leagues (Circuito Desafiante and Liga Regional Sur). The CBLOL will also be allocated one team for each international tournament (First Stand Tournament, Mid-Season Invitational, League of Legends World Championship). This was met by criticisms from fans, citing a low number of spots for the region, given the CBLOL teams' performance in the LTA Playoffs and uncertainties surrounding the formats of the international competitions in its current form. == References ==", "reasoning_summaries": null}

Named after the Star Wars character Chewbacca due to its long, flexible, \"hairy\" branches that evoke the Wookiee's fur, the species was formally described in 2025. It inhabits rocky seafloors in the tropical western Pacific Ocean at depths exceeding 400 meters, where it forms solitary colonies up to 1.2 meters tall. == Description == Iridogorgia chewbacca features a monopodial, spiral axis typical of its genus, with a brilliant iridescence that gives it a shimmering appearance under light. The colony grows upright and solitary, reaching heights of ~1.2 meters (4 feet) in specimens from near Molokaʻi, Hawaii, while those near the Mariana Trench measure around 50 cm (20 inches). Its branches are long and flexible, stretching up to 38 cm (15 inches), hanging downward in a \"shaggy\" manner that resembles hair, distinguishing it from stiffer-branched relatives. The polyps, numbering thousands per colony, extend tentacles for filter-feeding and give the branches a fuzzy texture when active. Unlike many corals that form dense reefs, I. chewbacca occurs scattered and alone on hard substrates, with its shiny, iridescent surface reflecting light in patterns akin to \"fireworks exploding from the seafloor\". Genetic markers, including mtMutS-cox1 and 28S rDNA, confirm its distinction from congeners, though mtMutS showed limited utility for delimitation within the genus. Spiral growth direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) does not serve as a reliable taxonomic trait. == Taxonomy == Iridogorgia chewbacca belongs to the genus Iridogorgia, in the family Chrysogorgiidae, order Malacalcyonacea, class Octocorallia, phylum Cnidaria.
