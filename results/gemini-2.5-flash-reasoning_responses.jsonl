His goal was to teach at an advanced secondary school, and he achieved that through the state exam and a doctorate. He then started his teaching career in Plauen, where he taught a range of subjects: Latin, Greek, German, and History. His work went beyond the classroom; he published philosophical works and researched the history of the Vogtland region. I see his academic interests extending beyond teaching, particularly into history. He transitioned to Chemnitz but continued to research and publish on the Vogtland's history, even contributing many articles on the subject, particularly between 1896 and 1903. This indicates a consistent dedication to history. The text also mentions his concern about the decline of Greek and Latin, and his attempt to combat this decline.\n\n"}

The album was reissued by Street Justice Records in 2018 featuring new cover art. == Background == This album was the first that band had recorded in five years. During that time the band almost disbanded; however, this album marked a comeback. It is a collection of re-recordings of some of the band's more well-known tracks, along with two brand new ones, \"Crossover Sucks\" and \"Shoot Charlton Heston\". Of the 22 tracks on the album, seven come from the band's first two records. Five come from Sudden Death Overtime, four more 16 Valve Hate, and the rest are made up from tracks on \"Old Tyme Hardcore\", \"Unconsciousness\", and \"Blast Furnace\". The CD included live video performances of their songs \"Step On It\" / \"Chip on My Shoulder\" and \"Olde Time Hardcore\" / \"Silence\" with \"Old Tyme Hardcore\". Along with this it included a collection of flyers for the band's various performances and extensive liner notes including a booklet that contained the history of the band. == Track listing == == Personnel == Slapshot Jack \"Choke\" Kelly – lead vocals Mike Bowser – guitar David Link – bass Mark Mckay – drums Technical personnel D.

Godfrey earned her doctorate in engineering at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where she studied waste data. == Research and career == Godfrey manages Circular Innovation South Africa, a programme that looks to move the country to a more circular and sustainable economy. She has argued that half of climate impacts and most biodiversity loss comes from the extraction and processing of resources. Godfrey is concerned that society consumes and disposes of too much waste, and that the majority of that ends up in landfill. Waste disposal typically occurs at uncontrolled dumpsites, and South Africa is decades behind other developed countries in how they handle waste. She has helped local, regional and international circular economy initiatives. She led the development and implementation of the Waste Research, Development and Innovation roadmap, which advocates for the uses science, technology and innovation in decision making. The decisions include shifting to recycling, using artificial intelligence and plant automation. In 2023 Godfrey ws awarded the Mail & Guardian STF-South32 Green Economy Award.

The user wants me to do something a little unusual. They've given me a block of text about a movie, *and* they've included a specific instruction, which *contains* the phrase \"Here is a sentence\".  My initial thought was that I needed to find \"Here is a sentence\" within the *movie text* and output everything before it. But there isn't one there.\n\nThen, I realized that the user *is* using \"Here is a sentence\" within the instruction they've given me. It's almost like a trick question! The user seems to want me to treat the instruction itself as part of the text I'm processing.\n\nSo, here's how I'm approaching this: The user's input *starts* with information about \"Muzzle: City of Wolves\", followed by the sentence \"how bad burns go to burn center.\"  After that, comes the main instruction: \"Now copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'. Do not change any words.\"\n\nThe key is that the string \"Here is a sentence\" is present, and my task is to output the string preceding this string within the *entire* provided input. The string I'm looking for is \"Here is a sentence\", and it appears *as part* of the user's main prompt.\n\nTherefore, I need to output everything before \"Here is a sentence\" in the input, which encompasses the text about the movie, and then the sentence \"how bad burns go to burn center.\"\n\nHere is my attempt to execute the instruction:\nMuzzle: City of Wolves is an upcoming American action thriller film directed, produced, and written by John Stalberg Jr. that serves as a sequel to Muzzle.

The abdomen is dorsally blackish, with a median, pale hairy, black-trimmed lancet band in front. Behind this are four slightly dark median angular spots accompanied on each side by a row of four white hair spots visible only when dry. Ventrally, the sternum is uniformly black, with coxae lighter brown and remaining leg segments whitish hairy, though the posterior metatarsi and tarsi are darkened. == Conservation == The species remains undersampled with a limited known range. More sampling is needed to determine the full geographic range. == Etymology == The species is named after Port Nolloth in the Northern Cape, where the type specimen was collected. == References ==", "reasoning_summaries": null}

This means I need to grab everything up to and including the example sentence.

The user wants me to grab some text, specifically everything *before* the phrase \"Here is a sentence\". The first thing I noticed is that this phrase is actually *part* of the input, not some external marker. That makes it a bit simpler, I think.\n\nThe initial instinct was to focus only on the text I was *given*, the \"acres northeast of...\" part. But the instruction specifies \"all the text before 'Here is a sentence'\", which suggests I should be searching the *entire* input, including the instruction itself. And the instruction *does* contain \"Here is a sentence\".\n\nLet's see: the input is a long block of text about land ownership, and somewhere in there is the magical phrase \"Here is a sentence\". Specifically, it's after \"documentation \", followed by \"Here is a sentence: ...\". The \"Now copy and output...\" bit is, as I understand it, part of the instruction.\n\nSo, I need to output everything *up to* (but not including) \"Here is a sentence\". I need to be careful with the colon too. This is simple string manipulation and slicing now. Make sure not to change any words, I get that.\n\nThe string I have to output is the text before \"Here is a sentence\" in the *entire* input, and the input itself is.\n\n```\nacres northeast of “Deutel” (Turtle) Bay, bounded by the commons and lands of Jacobus Fabricius and David De Voor.

The original form of the family name was apparently \"Joh(a)nsson\". == Life == After attending primary school and the Gymnasium (college preparatory school) in his home town of Freiberg, Germany, Johnson studied philosophy and philology at the university in Leipzig, with the intention of becoming a teacher at an advanced secondary school. In 1864, after passing the state exam and earning a Doctor of Philosopy degree, he began his probationary year of teaching at the Plauen Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Greek, German and History. In 1865 he finished his probationary year and earned a fixed employment position at the school. While employed as a teacher, he published philosophical works on the problem of Sensualism and made extensive investigations into the history of the Vogtland in Saxony, Germany. After his transfer to the Chemnitz Gymnasium in 1881, he used his free time for excursions to the Vogtland. As a historian he published several reports on the history of notable individuals and castles in the Vogtland. Between 1896 and 1903 he published over 162 articles under the title Vogtländische Altertümer (Vogtland Antiquities). Johnson worried about the waning influence of Ancient Greek and Latin.

The planet's orbital distance places it beyond the conventional habitable zone of its cool, low-luminosity host, though it may still have a temperate atmosphere, making it a target for further study. Its discovery is notable for demonstrating the detection of planets around fully convective M dwarfs, whose magnetic activity differs significantly from that of partly convective stars, and for showing that low-amplitude radial-velocity signals can be reliably extracted even in the presence of strong stellar magnetic fields. == References ==", "reasoning_summaries": null}

A few days", "reasoning_summaries": "**Breaking Down the Extraction Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a block of text, and the task is pretty straightforward, but requires precision. The core concept is \"substring extraction\" – a common operation in text processing that I'm very familiar with. The user wants me to isolate everything that comes *before* a specific marker phrase, \"Here is a sentence.\" I need to be exact; any extra characters, especially from the target phrase itself, would be a mistake.\n\nHere's how I'm approaching this:\n\n1.  **Pinpointing the Anchor:** First, I need to reliably find the exact starting point of the phrase \"Here is a sentence\". Think of it as finding a specific landmark in a vast landscape. I'll need to use either a find operation to identify this point in the string.\n2.  **Defining the Extraction Boundary:** The boundary of the text I want is essentially \"up to, but not including, the target phrase\". I need to keep in mind the boundary, so I don't mistakenly include any parts of the target phrase itself.\n3.  **Executing the Slice:** Now, I'll extract the required text. This boils down to applying a \"string slice\" operation, where I specify the start of the slice (the beginning of the provided text) and the end of the slice (right before the target phrase begins).\n4. **Accuracy Check:** I'll make sure that I don't include that marker phrase in the results. I should double-check the results, just to be sure.\n\n"}

He later performed in the 1975 Off-Broadway production Beethoven/Karl and collaborated frequently with his wife, Gloria Barret Carshon. Carshon was also closely associated with Sarah Lawrence College for decades. As head of the college’s Studio Theatre for 35 years, he directed student and resident company productions and mentored generations of actors. In the late 1970s, the Carshons’ resident company Green Gate Theatre presented Harold Pinter’s Old Times as part of the college’s “Summer Evenings at Sarah Lawrence” series, under Charles and Gloria’s direction. == Teaching == Beyond Sarah Lawrence, Carshon taught at New York City’s High School of Performing Arts, the Stella Adler Studio, the Neighborhood Playhouse, and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. His obituary notes that “many famous actors passed through his classes.” == Stage credits (selected) == Broadway The Tower Beyond Tragedy (Nov 26–Dec 22, 1950) — The Queen’s Slave (cast). Billy Budd (Feb 10–May 12, 1951) — company member (replacement). Off-Broadway Beethoven/Karl (1975) — performer. == Personal life ==", "reasoning_summaries": "**Focusing on Precision: My Task Unfolds**\n\nOkay, so the user has given me a specific task: to precisely extract and replicate text.

The instruction explicitly states I should *not* include the phrase \"Here is a sentence.\" in the output. That means I need to be careful with the way I define the boundary. I can't just find the index of the phrase and include everything up to that point; I have to be more nuanced to exclude the phrase itself. I'll need to figure out a method that allows for accurate string slicing or splitting based on the location of that phrase. No problem. This is a common and easily-solved text processing task.\n\n"}

They've given me a block of text about a doctor's career, and then a seemingly nonsensical prompt.  I need to figure out what they *really* want.  The core instruction seems to be: \"copy and output all the text before 'Here is a sentence'\".  However, the phrase \"Here is a sentence\" appears *within* the user's instructions. That's a bit of a head-scratcher.\n\nInitially, I thought, \"Well, the text *before* 'Here is a sentence' in the prompt is nothing, it's just an empty string!\". But then, the initial block of text is actually what the user provided, so it is the entire document.\n\nHowever, the way they framed it made me wonder if they meant for me to find \"Here is a sentence\" in the *original* document that they initially provided. It would be natural if the prompt and sentence were intended to define a target sentence.\n\nMy analysis went like this:\n1.  **Literal Interpretation:** I first took the instruction at face value. The text immediately before \"Here is a sentence\" in the *prompt itself* is nothing.  I was being very literal.\n2.  **Contextual Interpretation:** Then, I suspected a trick. The user provided an entire block of text.  The \"Here is a sentence\" may be introducing something, and so my instinct was to look for that sentence *within* the original document. I went back to the original text. The full document is, then, all the text before and including the target sentence.\n3.  **Ambiguity:** However, the instructions were still clear: I am to output all the text *before* the literal string \"Here is a sentence\".\n\nMy ultimate understanding is that the user is trying to make me think about the phrasing to solve an ambiguously worded riddle, and so the answer is the empty string, based on the verbatim instruction.\n\n"}

On 12 September 2025, Théodora performed on the Angela Davis stage at the Fête de l'Humanité in La Courneuve. The performance, attended by one of the festival's largest crowds, was noted for its political themes and was described as the most significant concert of her 2025 tour by her entourage. Later that month, she and her album Bad Boy Lovestory received the 18–20 prize, organized by the Prix Joséphine des artistes in collaboration with Télérama, Crédit Mutuel, and National Center of Music. The award is decided by a jury of thirteen young music enthusiasts. == Style and influences == Théodora's style has been described as a mix of goth, rap, and R&B influences. Her brother, Jeez Suave, serves as her main producer. Together they have incorporated elements of drum and bass, Creole folk music, Caribbean genres such as bouyon, and influences from her childhood spent in Greece, the Republic of the Congo, and Réunion.

He studied at Harvard University and New York Law School before deciding on a military career. On 7 May 1897, Rees enlisted in the United States Army, joining Company B of the Battalion of Engineers as a corporal. The Spanish–American War started in April 1898, and Rees performed duties associated with defense of strategically valuable waterways. In May 1898, Rees was one of eight soldiers who were run down by the French ocean liner SS La Touraine while they were laying mines in New York Harbor. The ship was putting out to sea, and did not stop or lower life boats, resulting in the drowning of two men. The other six, including Rees, were rescued. In November 1899, Rees was performing Philippine–American War Engineer duties in Malate, Philippines when he was notified that his application for a commission had been approved.

The user needs me to pull out a chunk of text, specifically everything that comes *before* a certain phrase: \"Here is a sentence.\" Easy enough, right?  The trick is, I need to be precise.  I can't just grab everything up to \"Here is a sentence,\" I need to stop *just before* it.  It's like carefully carving out a specific area, ensuring I don't accidentally take a slice of the forbidden territory. It's a task that hinges on accurate identification and delimitation. I know I have to be precise as the goal is to provide a correct answer. It is my job to complete all tasks assigned to me, in the format in which they are requested.\n\n"}
